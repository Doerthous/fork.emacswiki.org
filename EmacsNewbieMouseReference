Mouse usage in Emacs by default is somewhat different than it is in most other applications, and it can be confusing for an EmacsNewbie.

== Fundamentals ==

A mouse is a type of ''pointing device''.  Touchpads (as found on most laptops), trackballs, and most sorts of similar things, are all considered a mouse by Emacs.

Emacs uses the [[mouse pointer]], a graphic indicator of the mouse position.  Common pointer symbols used in Emacs include an arrow, an hourglass, an I-bar, and a pointing finger.

The mouse pointer should be distinguished from the TextCursor, which is typically a blinking bar, box, or underline.  The text cursor indicates the location of [[point]], where text will be inserted, and various other text operations occur.

== Button names ==

Emacs designates the primary mouse button as `mouse-1', and numbers them going up from there.  On a typical computer, `mouse-1' is the left mouse button.  (Left-handed people may have their computer set to swap the assignments of the left and right buttons.)

On a two-button mouse, the secondary (right) button is `mouse-3'.

The middle button, if any, is `mouse-2'.  On a two-button mouse, you can generally simulate it by pressing the left and right buttons together.  On mice with a scroll wheel, pressing the wheel (like a button) usually sends `mouse-2'.

== Basic mouse actions ==

Exactly what each mouse button does, depends on the type of [[buffer]] you are working in, and any [[mode]]s that might be in effect.  The general behavior is:

Clicking `mouse-1' (left mouse button) will move [[point]] (and thus the text cursor) to that location.  This is similar to most software.

Drag (press and hold) `mouse-1' to define the [[region]] --- that is, to select/highlight text.  The spot where you started dragging becomes [[mark]]; point moves to the end (where you released the button).

Click `mouse-2' (middle button) to [[CopyAndPaste|paste]] a copy of the selection.  If no region is active, Emacs uses the text of the last region you selected.  Text is inserted where you clicked.  Note that this does '''''not''''' paste the contents of the clipboard or kill ring.

Click `mouse-3' (right button) to ''extend'' the selection/region.  If there is already a region selected, this will make the region larger, to include everything from the end of the previous region, to the location clicked.  If there is no active selection, this will select starting from point, to the location clicked, making it the active region.

Use `C-mouse-3' (hold Control and right-click) to get a pop-up context menu.  This is equivalent to a plain right-click in most mainstream software.

== Intermediate mouse actions ==

Double-clicking `mouse-1' on a word selects the entire word.  Triple-click to select the entire line.  Combine either of these with a drag to select whole-words or whole-lines at once.

Double-click `mouse-3' to extend the region (as with a single click), and then cut/kill the selected text.

`C-mouse-1' pops up a menu with a list of buffers (open files).  Click a buffer on the menu to switch to that buffer.

Clicking `mouse-1' on a button or link follows/invokes it, as you might expect.  Pressing ''and holding'' `mouse-1' will move point to that location, without triggering it.

A ''secondary'' selection is available by pressing and holding the [[Meta]] key during mouse actions.  (The Meta key is also known as the Alt key, and written as `M-'.)  For example, `M-' while dragging creates and extends the secondary selection.  `M-mouse-2' pastes the secondary selection (that is, click `mouse-2' while holding Meta/Alt).

Press and hold both Control ''and'' Meta/Alt while dragging to define a rectangular selection region (ignoring lines and wrapping).

== Customization ==

Behavior of the mouse is most easily changed using the [[CustomizingAndSaving|Customization]] features of Emacs.  In the default graphical interface, click the ''Options'' menu, then ''Customize Emacs'' (at the bottom of the menu), and then ''Top-level Customization Group''.  That will load the main menu of the Customization subsystem.  Click the link for the ''Editing'' group.  On the resulting page, click ''Mouse'' in the list of subgroups.

For the most part, Emacs treats mouse buttons, scroll wheels, and other protuberances, like keyboard keys.  Changing what mouse buttons do is thus similar to assigning any other [[key binding]], just with its own MouseBindingNotation.
