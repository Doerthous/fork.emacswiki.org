From the Semantic manual, available [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/semantic/index.html online] or in the GNU Info documentation included with Emacs.

"Semantic is a suite of Emacs libraries and utilities for parsing source
code.  At its core is a lexical analyzer and two parser generators
(‘bovinator’ and ‘wisent’) written in Emacs Lisp.  Semantic provides a
variety of tools for making use of the parser output, including user
commands for code navigation and completion, as well as enhancements for
imenu, speedbar, whichfunc, eldoc, hippie-expand, and several other
parts of Emacs."
