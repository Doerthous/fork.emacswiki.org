This page is about library '''<tt>[[dyna-show.el]]</tt>''', which provides highlighting of occurrences of dynamically scoped variables in an EmacsLisp buffer, using [[minor mode]] '''`dyna-show-mode''''.

The variables are highlighted with face `dyna-variables'.

It uses `special-variable-p', which is limited. From the screenshot, you can see another limitation:
occurrences of a function, e.g. `font-lock-mode', that has the same name as a dynamic variable, are also
highlighted.

[[image:DynaShow]]

You can use library ##dyna-show.el## together with library '''<tt>[[hl-defined.el]]</tt>''', which highlight [[symbol]]s that are known to be defined functions and/or variables.  When used together, the highlighting of dynamic variables overrides the variable highlighting of ##hl-defined.el##.
