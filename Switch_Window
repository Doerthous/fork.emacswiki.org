Switch Window provides a way to switch between [EmacsWiki:Window Emacs
Windows] <em>visually</em>.  Depending on how you configure it, it
will show numbers or letters in each open Window and so you simply
press a single key to switch to that window.  This is much easier than
the default Emacs command keybinding <kbd>C-x o</kbd>.

It also provides commands that make it easier to resize Windows than
the Emacs defaults.

Switch Window used to be [Lisp:switch-window.el hosted in the elisp
area], but has since moved [https://github.com/dimitri/switch-window
to GitHub].

There is also a small section about Switch Window
[https://tapoueh.org/projects/#emacs-switch-window on the author's
homepage].
