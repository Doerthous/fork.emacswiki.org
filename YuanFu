== Me ==

a.k.a casouri.

I started using Emacs in 2017 when I was a freshman in college. I've been playing with it ever since.

You can find me on [https://emacs-china.org emacs-china] under the name casouri, or visit [https://archive.casouri.cat/note my blog]. I put all the packages I wrote on [https://www.github.com/casouri github]. 

[https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs My init.el]

== Some EMACS expansions that I like ==

    Eight       Megabytes      And        Constantly   Swapping      ;; hard to beat
    Even a      Master of      Arts       Comes        Simpler
    Emacs       Makes          A          Computer     Slow
    Elsewhere   Maybe          All        Commands are Simple
    Excellent   Manuals        Are        Clearly      Suppressed
    Embarrassed Manual-Writer  Accused of Communist    Subversion    ;; for the record, Emacs has a fantastic manual
