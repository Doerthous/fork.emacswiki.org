[[ja:実行パス]]
This variable is the equivalent of the ##PATH## environment variable for Emacs. It contains a list of directories Emacs will search for executables.

Here's an example of appending the /sw/bin directory to the exec-path and PATH variables (useful for Mac OS X users running LaTeX):

    (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/sw/bin"))
    (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/sw/bin")))

I found there are difference between exec-path and PATH.
* The value of environment variable “PATH” is used by emacs when you are running a shell in emacs, similar to when you are using a shell in a terminal. 
* The exec-path is used by emacs itself to find programs it needs for its features, such as spell checking, file compression, compiling, grep, diff, etc.

== Set `exec-path` to match shell PATH automatically ==

    (defun set-exec-path-from-shell-PATH ()
      "Set up Emacs' `exec-path' and PATH environment variable to match that used by the user's shell.
    This is particularly useful under Mac OSX, where GUI apps are not started from a shell."
      (interactive)
      (let ((path-from-shell (replace-regexp-in-string "[ \t\n]*$" "" (shell-command-to-string "$SHELL --login -i -c 'echo $PATH'"))))
        (setenv "PATH" path-from-shell)
        (setq exec-path (split-string path-from-shell path-separator))))
