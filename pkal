Hi, I'm a Emacs user (since 2014), developer (since 2017) and contributer (since 2019).

I have a personal website, where I sometimes post about Emacs: https://ruzkuku.com/.

== Packages ==

Here are a few packages on mine which I have contributed to ELPA or MELPA:

* [http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/shell-command+.html shell-command+]
* [https://melpa.org/#/0x0 0x0]
* [https://melpa.org/#/autocrypt autocrypt]
* [https://melpa.org/#/clang-capf clang-capf]
* [https://melpa.org/#/face-shift face-shift]
* [https://melpa.org/#/insert-kaomoji insert-kaomoji]

== Misc ==

In the modernisation debate I am not the traditional side, and prefer OOTB behaviour.
