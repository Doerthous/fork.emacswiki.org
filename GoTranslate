== Main features ==

# Completely **asynchronous**, without any blocking problems, so very smoothly
# Optimize the display of translation results, the interface is more **beautiful** and natural
# It is **convenient** for switch between different languages, and support many interactive operations
# The code is clean, and **easy to expand**. New functions can be constructed very simply

== Installation ==

With MELPA and package.el:

<pre>
M-x package-install RET go-translate RET

(require 'go-translate)
</pre>

Or manually download go-translate.el then put into /some-path, then add this to .emacs:

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "/some-path")
(require 'go-translate)
</pre>

== Configuration ==

First, config the local language and your default target language:

<pre>
(setq go-translate-local-language "en")
(setq go-translate-target-language "fr")
</pre>

If you have any other translation plans, then put them into go-translate-extra-directions:

<pre>
(add-to-list go-translate-extra-directions (cons "ja" "ru"))  ; from japanese to russian
(add-to-list go-translate-extra-directions (cons "en" "fr"))  ; from english to french

;; or
(setq go-translate-extra-directions '(("ja" . "ru") ("en" . "fr")))
<pre>

Other customizations you can look into custom-group - go-translate, eg:

<pre>
(setq go-translate-buffer-follow-p t)       ; focus the result window
(setq go-translate-buffer-source-fold-p t)  ; fold the source text in the result window
(setq go-translate-buffer-window-config ..) ; config the result window as your wish
</pre>

== Quick Usage ==

The core command is go-translate, and there are several extended commands such as go-translate-popup. You can bind keys for them. such as:

<pre>
(global-set-key "\C-ct" 'go-translate)
(global-set-key "\C-cT" 'go-translate-popup)
</pre>
