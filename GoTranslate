= Go Translate =

Powerful translator on Emacs. Supports multiple translation engines such as Google, Bing, deepL.

n addition to Google Translate, it now supports more engines like Google RPC API, Bing, DeepL. You can easily add other translation engines on the basis of the framework.

Very scalable, very flexible, asynchronous request and better user experience.

The reason I rewrite this is that I want to add the new RPC API of Google translation to this plugin. Since adding new API, it's not nice to implement the plugin as a translation framework first.

== Installation ==

With MELPA and package.el:

<pre>
M-x package-install RET go-translate RET

(require 'go-translate)
</pre>

Or manually download go-translate.el then put into /some-path, then add this to .emacs:

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "/some-path")
(require 'go-translate)
</pre>

== Configuration and Usage ==

First, config the languages and setup the translator:
<pre>
(require 'go-translate)

(setq gts-translate-list '(("en" "zh")))

(setq gts-default-translator
      (gts-translator
       :picker (gts-prompt-picker)
       :engines (list (gts-bing-engine) (gts-google-engine))
       :render (gts-buffer-render)))
</pre>

Then, fire the translation with command:
<pre>
M-x gts-do-translate
</pre>
