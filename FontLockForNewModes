If you are writing a new major mode, you might face the same problems as DaveFootitt:

I'm trying to font lock a new mode.  The problem is it doesn't
automatically do it, but will do if I call
`font-lock-fontify-buffer'.

Look in the file font-lock.el, where global-font-lock is defined and
documented.  The comments there tell that font-lock uses a not-so-clean
trick to know what modes support font-lock and which don't.  You need to
make your mode compliant with what font-lock expects to find.

Yuck -- gross hack . . .  The code in Emacs 20.7 says:

<pre>
 ;; Gross hack warning: Delicate readers should avert eyes now.
</pre>

What happens is this:

When a major mode is entered, it should run <code>kill-all-local-variables</code>. That will call `change-major-mode-hook'.
Font-lock will install <code>font-lock-change-major-mode</code> on <code>change-major-mode-hook</code>.
`font-lock-change-major-mode' will add `turn-on-font-lock-if-enabled' to `post-command-hook'.
This is gross.  It is also the reason why sometimes (very seldom) a buffer will only start to fontify after you do something in the buffer.  Now, having stuff on `post-command-hook' slows Emacs down.  That's why the first call to `turn-on-font-lock-if-enabled' will remove itself from `post-command-hook' again.

There used to be a link here to a tutorial by Scott Andrew Borton for creating a new mode with fontification; however, it has been dead for since 2010, and as of 2022, even the links at the wayback machine auto-redirect to a casino page. --Boruch Baum
