[[ko:버퍼]]

An Emacs '''[::buffer]''' contains content you are working with.

Buffers are similar to what other systems might call a ''file'', ''document'', or ''workspace''.

Buffers are shown in [[window]]s on the screen.  A buffer can be displayed in more than one window at a time, or need not be displayed at all.  At the bottom of each window is a ModeLine that describes the buffer and its state.  Every buffer has a unique ''buffer name''; the name is shown in the mode-line.

While buffers are often associated with files, buffers can contain much more than files.  Much of the power of Emacs comes from the numerous "applications" available for it, many of which present information in buffers of their own.

When you visit a file (AKA open, read, load), Emacs puts the file's contents into a buffer, stored in main memory (RAM).  Emacs picks a buffer name based on the file name, making it unique if needed.  When you save the buffer, the file is written to reflect your changes.  Instead of thinking that you are "editing a file", think that you are ''editing text in a buffer''.  When you kill (close) a buffer, its contents are discarded, and the memory released.  Normally Emacs will prompt you if there are unsaved changes.

By convention, buffers whose names start with an asterisk (##*##) are not associated with files.  For example, by default Emacs starts with an empty buffer named ##*scratch*##.  If such buffers have unsaved changes when you exit Emacs, these buffers are discarded without asking.

Buffers whose names start with a space are [[InvisibleBuffers|invisible]], hidden from many operations.  These are generally used by Emacs for internal purposes, and are not intended for user consumption.
