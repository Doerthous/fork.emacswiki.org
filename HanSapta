I have been using Emacs since early 00s.

I have learned much from EmacsWiki, and owe much to it. Thanks AlexSchroeder!

I am also much indebted to DrewAdams libraries and code, not only for functionality, but for teaching many Emacs users practical elisp.


=== Questions about EmacsWiki use ===

1. How can one ping another user?

2. How can one keep updated with changes to libraries? I would prefer not to use GitHub or other external sites.

3. Is there a backup of the whole site available as single tar file?
