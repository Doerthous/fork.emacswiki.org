This packet has compatibility issues when you update and use emacs27.  (When you try to delete any file it complains about the function incf).

There is an easy solution: 

1) Add to the beginning of trashcan.el

    (require 'cl-lib)

   This is the package that has the not deprecated version of incf

2) Change all the functions in trashcan.el that call for the non-deprecated version: cl-incf

I've attached the revised version of trashcan.el that I created after making these two changes.
