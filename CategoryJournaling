Many Emacs users keep an MeatBall:OnlineDiary, MeatBall:WebLog, or
something else along those lines, and many maintain it via one of
these funky Emacs tools.

This category lists EmacsLisp packages that help you maintain a weblog
or a similar website that gets updated frequently.

== Creating text files ==

* [[Journal]] -- create text files using the date as the filename
* PlannerMode -- helps you plan your life by pulling together BBDB, calendar, Gnus, and EmacsMuse
* EmacsMuse -- Muse can integrate well with PyBlosxom with the help of the muse-blosxom.el file.
* OrgBlogging -- blogging with OrgMode
* Lisp:tjic-website.el -- a few small functions for managing local files
  that later need to get scp-ed or ftp-ed to a website
* Lisp:tjic-blog.el -- an add-on to tjic-website which supports a blog
  (weblog)
* [[lisplog]] -- Create and manage a blog with Emacs. It supports rss too

Other packages that can be used with Emacs effortlessly, eg. because they
depend on plain text.

* [[http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/|Bloxsom]] is a web cgi that allows you to journal with normal flat files.  Each journal entry is a unique file. 

== Using an API ==

* [https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el mastodon.el] -- a client for Mastodon
* WebloggerMode -- for several blog APIs; Blogger, Metaweblog, Moveable Type, Live Journal, Wordpress
* wpmail.el <http://github.com/thomas11/wpmail/tree/master> -- for posting to Wordpress via e-mail. Currently only tested with wordpress.com.
* [[Tumblr]] -- implementation (currently only) for posting to Tumblr.
* gblogger: [[http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/|Full-featured and up-to-date tools for the Google API]]. Part of the emacspeak suite, but available separately.
* <nowiki>LiveJournal</nowiki> clients (see MeatBall:LiveJournal)
** LjUpdate
** [[http://www.jwz.org/hacks/jwz-lj.el|jwz-lj.el]] 
* EmacsAtomApi -- an interface to weblog services which present the [[http://atomenabled.org|Atom API]].
* [[http://www.marginalia.org/code/mt.el|mt.el]] - Moveable Type (This package works well enough, but it only gives access to ''title'', ''description'' i.e. Body, and the categories. It would be nice to have: ''mt_allow_comments'', ''mt_allow_pings'', ''mt_text_more'', ''mt_excerpt'', ''mt_keywords'', ''mt_tb_ping_urls''. Looking over mt.el, it would seem that it's relatively easy to add these, but I'm not a Lisp programmer.)
* [[Identica-mode]] -- post to any laconi.ca server (similar to [[Twitter]] but free)
* [[Twitter]] -- post to twitter.com using various modes
* [[Eblog]] - provides an MUA-like interface for posting to Blogger using the new GData API.
