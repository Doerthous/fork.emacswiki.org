Once upon a time was the PCL-CVS maintainer.

Has used many different major and minor variants of Emacs and Emacs-like editors (starting with [[WikiPedia:Gosling Emacs]] and [[MulticsEmacs]]), but never [[XEmacs]] for some odd reason.

Most favourite [[ErsatzEmacs]] implementation is [[Jove]].  It is by far the most stable and bug-free of all small/micro Emacs implementations, though it has serious limitations.
