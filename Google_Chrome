Google Chrome and Google Chromium are WebKit based browsers with a
souped up JavaScript engine for running complex web-apps.

== Integrating with Emacs ==

You can use Emacs to edit textareas in the manner of It's All Text
using the [[Edit with Emacs]] Chrome/Chromium) extension.  It comes with its
own elisp based "Edit Server" to respond to edit requests from Chrome
without needing to use emacsclient.

Get it from
[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh
the Chrome web store].

== Atomic Chrome for Emacs ==

The Atom fans have implemented an
[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atomic-chrome/lhaoghhllmiaaagaffababmkdllgfcmc
extension]] to talk to Chrome over a websocket.  The same extension
can be used to interface Chrome with Emacs.

As mentioned on the [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome
github page]], there are a few advantages over [[Edit with Emacs]]

* The input on Emacs is reflected to the browser instantly and
  continuously.
* You can use both the browser and Emacs at the same time.  They are
  updated to the same content bi-directionally.
* You can associate the mode based on the URL.  e.g. gfm-mode for
  github.com, TextileMode for redmine, etc.

To complete the Emacs side of the setup, you need the atomic-chrome
package which is available on [[MELPA]].

=== Atomic Chrome for Mozilla Firefox with GhostText ===

If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can also use the atomic-chrome MELPA
package together with the
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghosttext/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search
GhostText Firefox extension] enabling you to advantage of the same
features as Chrome/Chromium above.
