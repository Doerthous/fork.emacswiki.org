== Introduction ==

This package provides <code>marginalia-mode</code> which adds marginalia to the minibuffer completions. Marginalia are marks or annotations placed at the margin of the page of a book or in this case helpful colorful annotations placed at the margin of the minibuffer for your completion candidates. Marginalia can only add annotations to be displayed with the completion candidates. It cannot modify the appearance of the candidates themselves, which are shown as supplied by the original commands.

The annotations are added based on the completion category. For example find-file reports the file category and M-x reports the command category. You can cycle between more or less detailed annotators or even disable the annotator with command marginalia-cycle


== Basic configuration ==

{{{
;; Enable richer annotations using the Marginalia package
(use-package marginalia
  ;; Either bind `marginalia-cycle` globally or only in the minibuffer
  :bind (("M-A" . marginalia-cycle)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-A" . marginalia-cycle))

  ;; The :init configuration is always executed (Not lazy!)
  :init

  ;; Must be in the :init section of use-package such that the mode gets
  ;; enabled right away. Note that this forces loading the package.
  (marginalia-mode))
}}}
