I think turn-on-gnus-dired-mode should be placed here. See http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/14514/how-to-attach-multiple-files-in-message-mode

Placed where? You are free to edit page DiredMode, if you think something should be added there.

If it is about Gnus then please also link to the most appropriate wiki page(s) for Gnus.

Thanks Drew!  After reading your comment I think information about turn-on-gnus-dired-mode fits better to the gnus side than to the dired side.

I put an entry to https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusNiftyTricks.

could not find anything meaningful about this after searching web.
I am using fedora32, Xorg, mate desktop + marco window manager, 
xterm, and emacs -nw, and dired mode with OpenWith melpa emacs package.
it is very common to work e.g. on a list of items in emacs dired mode,
successively launching a second Xorg window (e.g. a pdf viewer)
to deal with each item.  when done with the second window, 
return to where you were in the first window.  
This has always been the standard.

Focus switches from the emacs window to 
the pdf viewer (e.g. evince).  
When I close the pdf file (evince), NO WINDOW has the
focus.  I would expect the emacs window to have the focus.
This same behavior may apply to other applications, not just emacs, 
xterm and evince.  I am also suspicious that mate/marco are to blame.
I think the problem may go away when you switch from marco to compiz either running under mate.

Yeah, once you're using Emacs in a terminal emulator, all the window management is handled by your window manager.
There's nothing Emacs can do about it.
