In this page, we are providing methods/tools to interact with Google Drive Docs. Our need can be divided into these 2 components:
# A tool for synchronizing Google Drive contents on the local filesystem with the Google Drive cloud.
# A way to edit Google Docs using Emacs

Note that Google Doc files aren't plain-text. So, they have to be converted to a suitable format for editing by Emacs. A popular way to do this is to convert Google Docs to Markdown/rST using *pandoc* and then edit it using Emacs. After editing, it is then again converted back to Google Docs using *pandoc*.

Note: Google Docs is [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html Software as a Service]]. [[https://nextcloud.com/ NextCloud]] is a free alternative with support for plain markdown files, editable from Emacs.


== Using GDrive ==
Another option using [[https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive gdrive]] (requires helm for completion)

    (defvar gdocs-folder-id "<gdrive folder for exported docs>"
     "location for storing org to gdocs exported files, use 'gdrive list  -t <foldername>' to find the id")

    (defun gdoc-export-buffer ()
      "Export current buffer as google doc to folder identified by gdocs-folder-id"
      (interactive)
      (shell-command
      (format "gdrive upload --convert --mimetype text/plain --parent %s --file %s"
          gdocs-folder-id buffer-file-name)))

    (defun gdoc-import-buffer (doc)
       "Import a file in gdocs-folder-id into current buffer"
       (interactive 
       (list
          (completing-read "Choose one: "
                     (split-string
                      (shell-command-to-string
                       (format "gdrive list -q \"'%s' in parents\"" gdocs-folder-id)) "\n"))))
      (insert (replace-regexp-in-string (string ?\C-m) (string ?\C-j) (shell-command-to-string
      (format "gdrive download -s --format txt --id %s" (car (split-string doc " ")))))))

== Access Google Drive filesystem ==

This will not let you edit Google Doc files by itself, but you can access a Google Drive and Nextcloud file systems using the built-in [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html TRAMP]. This requires GVFS (the GNOME Virtual File System).
