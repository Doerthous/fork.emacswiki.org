Xwidgets are a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK+ and NS
widgets inside buffers.

At present, only WebKit widgets are implemented.

To try out xwidgets, you should build a recent copy of the `master'
branch from the Emacs Git repository.

Then, make sure all dependencies are installed, and configure Emacs as
such:

  ./configure --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-xwidgets ...

Where ... denotes any futher options you may want to pass to
configure.

After the compilation completes, you can run Emacs like such:

  src/emacs  (Where `src' is the `src' directory inside the
              directory where you cloned the Git repository)

And type

  M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url RET

You can then enter a URL, and you will find a functional web browser
installed.

If Emacs then proceeeds to crash with SIGTRAP, your WebKitGTK has a
bug.  See etc/PROBLEMS, but in short, you must run Emacs like this
instead:

  SNAP=1 SNAP_NAME=1 SNAP_REVISION=1 src/emacs ...

Where "..." are any other options you may want to pass Emacs.

Inside the web browser, you can type `e' to enter "edit mode", where
self inserting characters are passed to the WebKit widget, or `C-s' to
perform incremental search on the contents of the WebKit widget.

Your help is needed to make this feature stable.  Please report any
bugs you find to bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (use M-x report-emacs-bug) and
read (emacs)Bugs in the manual.  And when doing so, make sure to put
me in the X-Debbugs-Cc: field of the e-mail to the bug tracker, like
so:

  From: J. Random Hacker <frobber@bumblebee>
  To: bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org
  Subject: 29.0.50; Trying to thump page in Xwidget Webkit leads to page being thonked instead.

Thanks.
