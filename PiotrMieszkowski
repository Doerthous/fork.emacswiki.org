My full name is Piotr Filip Mieszkowski.  I use GnuEmacs in my everyday work, which is software engineering.

I'm impressed by the huge possibilities these Lisp-enabled editors have.  For some time I have been using a few other editors.  Some of them were tty-oriented, others were window and mouse-oriented (wily is an example).  All of them had something interesting and useful.  Emacs is my choice because it is /really/ flexible and is so much more than just a text editor.

I *use* GnuEmacs.

I've tried GnuEmacs, [[XEmacs]] (a little), Hemlock (from the CMU CL) and Climacs.

I'm not an [[Elisp]] guru, but I think that everyone's ideas are worth sharing 
- this is what the GNU and Free Software is all about, isn't it?

* KeyboardMacros, [[register]]s and [[bookmark]]s
* OccurMode, hi-lock
* SavePlace
* CompanyMode
* LspMode with Java and Scala language servers

* [[Magit]]
* countless modes supporting file-types (sources in various languages, configuration formats and more).
