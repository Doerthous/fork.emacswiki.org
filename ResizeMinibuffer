In Emacs 20 we used resize-minibuffer-mode, but in Emacs 21 this is
the default.  The size of the EchoArea (not the MiniBuffer) is
controlled by max-mini-window-height.

To answer the question of everyone who comes to this page interested in learning how to resize the minibuffer: click and drag on the border. Something so obvious it's not worth writing down, it seems. -- KHilliard
