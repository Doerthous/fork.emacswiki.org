'''Mpc''' is the Emacs frontend to '''MPD''', the Music Player Daemon. It aims to look and feel similar to Rhythmbox.

Mpc first appeared in Emacs 23.2.

== Usage ==

You will need to install `mpd' on your computer and configure it like so:

{{{
# inside ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf
# This example is for PulseAudio

 bind_to_address "127.0.0.1"
 music_directory "~/music"

 audio_output {  
     type       "pulse"  
     name       "pulse audio"
     device     "pulse" 
     mixer_type "hardware" 
 }  

audio_output {
    type   "fifo"
    name   "my_fifo"
    path   "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
    format "44100:16:2"
}
}}}

Then you can run it with the `mpd' command, and from then you can run `M-x mpc' from inside Emacs.

== Configuration ==

You can use <code>M-x customize-group <RET> mpc </code> to customize the client. You can change some variables in <code>init.el</code> like so:

{{{
(setq
  mpc-browser-tags '(Artist Album)
  mpc-songs-format "%-5{Time} %25{Title} %20{Album} %20{Artist}"
}}}
