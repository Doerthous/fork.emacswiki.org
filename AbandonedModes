Emacs planet is huge. Modes are created every day or so but there are
also big hits going into anonymous death.

I propose to list here any mode that users liked and that suddenly
disappeared (no maintainer, ...).

The main goal is to have in front of each one the name of a new
volunteer.

= The list =

* OrganizerMode
* YourModeGoesHere

== OrganizerMode ==

I tried to get rid of the Buffer-* functions and replaced it by a
simpler method invoking `read-file-name'. This works but many orther
functions won't work anymore. Anyway, that will let other start using
this mode and maybe adopt it :)
