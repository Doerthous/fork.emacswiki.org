DiredMode is the base-line major mode for Emacs "file-manager" style operations, used by '''[::Dired]''' buffers. It differs in many ways from dedicated "file-manager" programs, but the basic behavior is comparable. As it is a component the Emacs "editor", some users speak of "editing" a directory, not "exploring" or "managing" one.

A single dired buffer can be made to display the contents of a single directory along with the contents of zero or more sub-directories. It can be limited to display a filtered subset of those contents and can display either just file names or any combination of additional file details.

All the operations you expect from a "file manager" are available, plus some specific to Emacs such as the ability to single-click byte-compile files.

Bulk renaming of files is especially easy and powerful in '''[::Dired]''' buffers: You enter [[[WDired]] (ie. writable dired) mode, in which the buffer becomes editable, and you can perform any Emacs editing operation on the buffer contents. You can even use that mode to change file ownerships and privileges!

Operations can be performed on groups of files by either first "marking" them (m), or in the case of deletions "tagging" them (d).

Launch Dired using the default keybindings `C-x d' or `C-x 4 d' followed by a path.

The Emacs menu bar can be helpful to new users to learn the default keybindings and available operations, and there's always `C-h m' and the Info manual: `C-h i', choose Emacs, then choose Dired under Advanced Features. (Or read [[Manual:Dired]] online.)

Dired has spawned many extensions and related packages. Some have been integrated into Emacs core:

* [[Dired X]] -- Many extra features (library ##dired-x.el##).
* DiredOmitMode -- Selectively remove files and subdirectories from the display, to reduce clutter.
* DiredSearchAndReplace -- Search multiple files.
* [[WDired]] -- Rename files by editing names directly in the Dired buffer.
* [[Image Dired Thumbnail Mode]] -- edit directories full of images

== External Dired packages ==

=== Curated Dired customization layers ===

The following packages all try to make Dired friendlier to use by a combination of adding features and presenting existing features in a way more familiar to users coming from other "file managers".

* [https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/emacs-diredc diredc] -- Robust dual-pane dired with many Midnight Commander features, and more (2021 active)
* [[Sunrise_Commander]] -- Midnight Commander clone ([https://github.com/sunrise-commander/sunrise-commander github], 2021 active)
* [Lisp:di.el DiMode] -- simple directory editor for GNU Emacs (JoeKeane, (2013 orphaned).
* MidnightCommanderMode -- emulates Midnight Commander (2013 orphaned)
* NortonCommanderMode -- emulates Norton Commander (2009 orphaned)


=== Individual external Dired packages ===

Following are a uasi-random accumulation of external dired-related packages, in alphabetical order. Others are available on MELPA. Some may be obsolete or orphaned, so check first (and update this page). This is the remainder of the old version of this page, so parts of it may still be a dis-organized mash-up.

* [[Anything]] -- After evaluating ##(anything-dired-bindings)##, some dired commands are replaced with Anything-based interface.
* [[Bookmark+]] 
** In the bookmark list, `##M-d >##' opens Dired on the marked file and directory bookmarks (only).
** In Dired, `C-j' jumps among different "views" or states of the same Dired buffer.
** You can bookmark any Dired buffer -- its current state. Jump among Dired bookmarks using `J' in Dired (or `C-x j d' globally).
** In Dired, `M-b' bookmarks each of the marked files and dirs.
* [[Dired+]] -- Extends standard Emacs libraries ##dired.el##, ##dired-aux.el##, and ##dired-x.el## in many ways.
* DiredBookmarks -- Save/restore Dired state persistently, including switches, marked files, inserted subdirectories, and hidden (sub)directories.
* DiredDetails -- Lets you hide or show the file and directory details in a Dired listing, to save space and clutter.
** When details are hidden, all you see (and all IncrementalSearch sees) are the file names.
* DiredDragAndDrop -- Lets you drag-and-drop files.
* DiredEfap -- Rename the file at [[point]] in Dired.
* [[Diredful]] -- Colorful file names in dired buffers.
* [[DiredFileTypeFaces]] -- Colorful file names in dired buffers.
* [https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks dired-hacks] -- Collection of useful dired additions.
* DiredSync -- Synchronize directories within dired (2014)
* DiredTar - extension for creating and unpacking tar-files from Dired
* DiredTweaks -- Small Dired tweaks.
* DiredView -- Browse and select files using the first character of their names.
* [https://gitlab.com/xuhdev/dired-icon dired-icon] -- display file icons in dired buffers.
* [https://github.com/fasheng/dired-toggle dired-toggle.el] -- provide a simple way to toggle dired buffer for current directory, similar to `dired-jump'(`C-x C-j')
* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/dired-visit-history/index.html dired-visit-history.el] -- add dired visits to <code>file-name-history</code>
* [[Files+]] -- 
** Integrates `find-file' (`C-x C-f') and related commands with Dired
** Together with <tt>[[ls-lisp+.el]]</tt>, modifies `insert-directory' so that Dired's second header line lists the number of files:
 '''##files 691##''' ##space used 49439 available 56233408##
* [[GrepMode#GrepOnlyMarkedFiles|`grep' the marked files]]
* [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements]] -- [[minibuffer]] [[regexp]] [[completion]] and completion-candidate [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] to navigate directories and perform operations on files
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#SearchAndReplace|Search-and-replace]] on the marked files.
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#SaveFilesAsCandidates|Save marked file names]] as completion candidates for later reuse.
** [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#OpenDiredOnSavedFiles|Open Dired on saved file names]] (`##C-M-<##'), that is, names that you previously saved as an Emacs [[fileset]] or as an Icicles completion candidates set.
* Isearch
** DiredIsearch -- Run `isearch' in Dired, but match only file names
** DiredLis -- Letter `isearch' in dired mode, not nedd press some keys to active `isearch-mode'.
* OperatingOnFilesInDired – Opening files in associated applications.
* ThumbsMode -- Modify dired for automatic image previewing.
* [[Trashcan]] -- A recoverable file-deletion system that behaves like the trash can or recycle bin of many operating systems.
* [[Virtual Dired]] -- edit text files that list files as if they were directory listings.

== Windows specific tips and additional features ==

* DiredWThirtyTwoTweaks
* MsShellExecute -- Open any file from dired on W32 systems
* WThirtyTwoFindDired -- Light, w32-specific version of `find-dired'.
