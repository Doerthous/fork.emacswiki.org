'''[::Dired]''' is the main mode for Emacs file-manager operations. The name "Dired" stands for "directory editor". 

A single Dired buffer can display the contents of a single directory, or it can include listings of one or more sub-directories. A Dired buffer can alternatively display an ''arbitrary'' set of files and directories, from any file systems.

A Dired buffer can display a filtered subset of directory contents, and it can show either just file names or additional file details.

All the operations you expect from a typical file-manager application are available in Dired, plus some that are specific to Emacs.

You can use '''`C-x C-q'''' to make a Dired buffer editable. This enters [[WDired]] mode (writable Dired). For example, you can use this to bulk-rename files, or to change file ownerships and privileges.

You can operate on multiple files after ''marking'' them. The usual mark is '''`##*##'''', but the mark used for deletion is '''`D''''. `D' marks are also called ''flags'', and the operation of marking with `D' is also called ''flagging''.

You visit a directory in Dired mode using key bindings '''`C-x d'''', `C-x 4 d', and `C-x 5 d'.

The [[menu bar]] is helpful for learning operations and key bindings. As always, '''`C-h m'''' provides information on the mode. Consult the Emacs manual (`C-h r') for more info -- choose ''Dired'' under ''Advanced Features''. You can also read about [[Manual:Dired]] online.)

* [[Bookmark+]] 
** In the bookmark list, `##M-d >##' opens Dired on the marked file and directory bookmarks (only).
** In Dired, `C-j' jumps among different "views" or states of the same Dired buffer.
** You can bookmark any Dired buffer -- its current state. Jump among Dired bookmarks using `J' in Dired (or `C-x j d' globally).
** In Dired, `M-b' bookmarks each of the marked files and dirs.
* [[Dired+]] -- Extends standard Emacs libraries ##dired.el##, ##dired-aux.el##, and ##dired-x.el## in many ways. (see also: DiredPlus)

* [https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/emacs-diredc diredc] -- Dual-pane Dired with many Midnight Commander features, and more.
* DiredDetails -- Hide or show file and directory details in a Dired listing. When details are hidden, all you see (and all IncrementalSearch sees) are the file names.

* [https://github.com/fasheng/dired-toggle dired-toggle.el] -- A simple way to toggle Dired buffer for current directory, similar to `dired-jump'(`C-x C-j')
* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/dired-visit-history/index.html dired-visit-history.el] -- Add Dired visits to `file-name-history'.
* [[Files+]] -- (see also: FilesPlus)
** Integrates `find-file' (`C-x C-f') and related commands with Dired
** Together with <tt>[[ls-lisp+.el]]</tt>, modifies `insert-directory' so that Dired's second header line lists the number of files:
 '''##files 691##''' ##space used 49439 available 56233408##
