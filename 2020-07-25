And another problem. I was getting SSL errors every now and then, using Firefox.
Calling ##openssl s_client www.emacswiki.org:443## did in fact say that it was expired:

{{{
depth=0 CN = emacswiki.org
verify error:num=10:certificate has expired
notAfter=Jul 25 03:49:05 2020 GMT
}}}

But my ACME client disagreed:

{{{
Processing emacswiki.org with alternative names: www.emacswiki.org
 + Hook: Nothing to do...
 + Checking domain name(s) of existing cert... unchanged.
 + Checking expire date of existing cert...
 + Valid till Sep 26 03:48:59 2020 GMT (Longer than 30 days). Skipping renew!
 + Hook: Nothing to do...
}}}

Uhhhh... What?

Then I remembered... Restarting Apache fixed the issue.

I still don't get it. I do and ##service apache2 reload## when a new cert is deployed.
But somehow that doesn't work.

Anyway, I'm sorry if this caused you any issues.
