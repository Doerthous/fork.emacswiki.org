[[ja:カテゴリ・マウス]]
Click the page heading above for a list of pages in this category.

This category is about using the mouse in Emacs.

Pages in this category should have particular content specific to how the mouse is used or works (within Emacs, of course), and not simply mention the mouse or a mouse binding.

Include pages that address standard Emacs uses of mouse buttons, such as how to use the mouse to navigate, edit text, and invoke other features.  Pages dealing with mouse actions and configuring the mouse (buttons, wheel) also belong in category Mouse.

Otherwise, category Mouse does ''not'' include topics that merely mention mouse bindings, unless those bindings do something specifically related to the mouse. This also means that
Category Mouse does not include topics about mouse-initiated menus (popup menus), except information on how to bind menus to mouse actions or information about menus that pertain to the mouse itself.
