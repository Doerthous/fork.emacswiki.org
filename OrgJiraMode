==Introduction ==

##org-jira## is a mode for interacting with [https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira Jira] from OrgMode.

It was created by BaoHaojun in 2011, and has been maintained by Matthew Carter since 2016 at https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira. Its access library ##jiralib.el## is based in part on SoapClient's sample jira2.el and [[jira.el]]. Its org layer uses some ideas from [https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog org2blog].
==Features ==
===Sync Jira tickets into Org-mode todo items in a batch mode ===
Jira ticket attributes such as priority, status, resolution, summary, description, etc. are supported. New ones can be added if desired by hacking the elisp.

See the following example. Jira ticket summary has been used as the Org TODO headline; most Jira ticket attributes have been made into Org entry; Jira description attribute is made into a separate subtitle because unlike most attributes it is multi-line.
<pre>
* TODO test summary                                          :SANDBOX_22:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :assignee: hjbao
  :reporter: hjbao
  :type:     Bug
  :priority: Major
  :status:   Open
  :ID:       SANDBOX-22
  :END:

** description: SANDBOX-22
test description
** Comment: Bao Haojun
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       21322
   :END:
test comment
</pre>
Also note the ID Org entry, both the Jira issue and Jira comment has an attribute ideal for this entry. Org-mode has an API for finding heading from ID entry.

===Update Org-mode new edits back to Jira ===

After you edit the attributes, such as change priority from "Major" to "Minor", you can post it back the Jira.

===Progress Jira ticket workflow in Org-mode ===

You can Resolve/Close/Reopen the jira ticket and so on, without leaving org-mode!

===Create new Jira issue in org mode ===

You can create new Jira issue within org mode. You will be prompted for Jira ticket information such as create in which project, assign to whom, and one-line summary, etc.

===Convert existing org mode TODO item into Jira ticket ===

This one is similar to the create-new-issue case, except the existing TODO headline can be used for Jira ticket summary.

The old TODO is deleted. But you will not lose a TODO entry, instead, you will trade a normal TODO for a Jira ticket tracked TODO.

===Edit existing Jira comments / add new comment ===

These are also supported.

==Usage ==

See [https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira org-jira on github] for setup and usage instructions.
