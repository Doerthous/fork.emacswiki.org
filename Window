In Emacs-speak, a '''[::window]''' is a [[frame]] pane, that is, a subframe. What is usually called a "window" outside of Emacs is called a '''[[frame]]''' in Emacs.
A window displays the contents of a single ''[[buffer]]''. A buffer need not be displayed in a window, however.

At the bottom of each window is a ModeLine that describes its contents and status.

Here's a screenshot showing a frame with three windows:

Commonly used window commands include these:
