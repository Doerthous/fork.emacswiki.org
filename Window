An Emacs '''window''' is the major display element in Emacs.

What is usually called a "window" outside of Emacs is called a ''[[frame]]'' in Emacs.  The Emacs internal windows would usually be called “panes” or “sub-windows” or “MDI windows” or some other term.  When not otherwise qualified, this wiki uses ''window'' to mean an Emacs internal window.

A window displays the contents of a single ''[[buffer]]''.  In the simplest case, this is a file you are visiting (editing), though buffers can also be many other things.  A buffer can be displayed in more than one window at a time, or need not be displayed at all.

At the bottom of each window is a ModeLine that describes its contents and status.

In this screenshot, colored boxes have been added to identify the frame (red), and three windows (in blue, green, and yellow).
