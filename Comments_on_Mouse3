In the 2nd para you have "The command bound to ‘mouse-3’ is ‘mouse-save-then-kill’. It is a complicated command ...". Reading on, to me this was confusing. It had me wondering if at this time you were talking about emacs/default or about mouse3.el. Again reading on, it became apparent (but not without the prior confusion, and to my surprise) that you were talking about emacs/default.

Not sure what would make it clearer.

In this order, these are the points made there:

1. `mouse-3' is bound to that command.

2. Some info about that command - complexity, limitations.

3. ##mouse3.el## '''redefines''' that command, to make it more flexible.

: Library mouse3.el lets you define the behavior. It **redefines standard command ‘mouse-save-then-kill’** in a trivial way to give you custom behavior for a second ‘mouse-3’ click at the same spot.
