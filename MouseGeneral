General information about using the mouse in Emacs, how to customize it, and how it works internally.

* Mouse [[pointer]] -- Graphic indicator of the mouse position. Common pointer symbols used in Emacs include an arrow, an hourglass, an ''I''-bar, and a pointing finger.
* `mouse-face' property -- [[text property|Text property]] whose value is a face that is seen only when the mouse is over text with that property. When it is shown, faces used for the `face' text property are not shown. Typically, `mouse-face' highlighting indicates that clicking the mouse on the highlighted text will perform an action that is different from clicking it elsewhere. Hypertext links are often highlighted using property `mouse-face'.
* ''mouse actions'' -- Use of mouse buttons, a mouse wheel, and mouse motion in Emacs.  Mouse actions are a subset of key sequences (see CategoryKeys).
