I use Emacs and has used it since 1994.

I made a few contributions to Emacs, [[Gnus]] and AUCTeX and created a couple of other  [https://marmalade-repo.org/profile/arne packages distributed via Marmalade Repo] and [https://melpa.org/#/?q=arnested Melpa].

As my day job I'm a developer at [https://reload.dk Reload].
