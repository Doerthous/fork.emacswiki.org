Similar to command log mode, this package displays the key press and its associated function on the mode line

Great for learning a new major/minor mode and also screen casting 

To make it work with doom-modeline

(use-package keycast
  :init
  (add-to-list 'global-mode-string '("" mode-line-keycast))
  (keycast-mode))
}}}
