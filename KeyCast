Similar to command log mode, this package displays the key press and its associated function on the mode line

Great for learning a new major/minor mode and also screen casting 

To make it work with doom-modeline

{{{
(use-package keycast
  :config
  ;; This works with doom-modeline, inspired by this comment:
  ;; https://github.com/tarsius/keycast/issues/7#issuecomment-627604064
  (define-minor-mode keycast-mode
    "Show current command and its key binding in the mode line."
    :global t
    (if keycast-mode
	(add-hook 'pre-command-hook 'keycast--update t)
      (remove-hook 'pre-command-hook 'keycast--update)))
  (add-to-list 'global-mode-string '("" mode-line-keycast " "))
  (keycast-mode))
