Unfilling a paragraph joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single
line.  It is the inverse of FillParagraph.

== Function ==

To make a paragraph end in a single newline use the function below.  It works where a line ends with a newline character ("\n") and paragraphs are separated by blank lines.  

    ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph    
    (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region)
      "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text."
      (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t)))
      (let ((fill-column (point-max))
            ;; This would override `fill-column' if it's an integer.
            (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t))
        (fill-paragraph nil region)))
    
    ;; Handy key definition
    (define-key global-map "\M-Q" 'unfill-paragraph)

== Key sequence ==

One can manually set `fill-column' to some large value.  Once that is done, ##M-q## (`fill-paragraph') effectively unfills paragraphs.

For example, press:

    ESC 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 C-x f

That is eight presses of the ##9## key, as a prefix argument to `set-fill-column'.  Any more nines causes the value to wrap.

The function works the same way; it simply limits the effect to the body of the function, using `let'.
