A '''mode''' is a set of behaviors.

A great deal of the functionality of Emacs is grouped into the various modes available.  Modes can be applied to individual [[buffer]]s, or globally to Emacs as a whole.

Every buffer has a single MajorMode, typically related to the type of file being edited.  Buffers can optionally have one or more [[MinorMode]]s applied as well.

Modes can do such varied things as:
* Change how text is displayed
* Customize what is displayed in the ModeLine
* Determine features such as:
** [[Indentation]]
** SyntaxHighlighting
** Word [[completion]]
