Emacs Hangouts were informal virtual meetups hosted on the Google Hangouts on Air platform by SachaChua. She has since gotten pretty busy with parenting, but you can check out EmacsUsergroups for other online meetups. Recordings and notes from past hangouts can be found at http://sachachua.com/blog/tag/emacs-hangout .
