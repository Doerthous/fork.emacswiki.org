I love the colored text, I love the status (PHPs:OK) or (PHPs:Error). I absolutely hate the (Special) buffer that splits the window or switches buffers in another pane.  It pops up everytime I am too slow to close a quote string, closes parenthesis or braces.  If I start a command and want to use the mouse to paste some other code from another buffer (common when working with SQL) then I am constantly hitting ^X1 or having to go reset the other buffer so I can see the code I wanted to paste from.  I KNOW I will need to close a quote, the status mentioned above tells me that ... how do I stop the needless window setup corruption from occurring 1 second after I start?  It's so annoying I'd 'almost' rather not have php-mode.

FYI: Searching on the internet yields tons of answers of how to stop errors when 'executing' PHP. I have yet to find how to stop the error 'buffer' when editing PHP. If there is a option, it needs to be made more apparent to the casual user.
