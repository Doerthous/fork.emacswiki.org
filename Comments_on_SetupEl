I didn't realize that you had created this library, which has the same name as my library <tt>[[setup.el]]</tt> (in the %%EmacsWiki%% ElispArea), which has existed since 1996 and been on the wiki since 2004.

I'm hoping you're rename yours that uses the same name. (Admittedly, the name is not a great one nowadays, in any case; it's been around a long time.)

Thx - DrewAdams

I found out about your setup.el recently, but sadly too late, as I and others have been using it for a while now. Should be maybe add Wikipedia style "Disambiguation" links to avoid confusion?

''"for a while now"''

You certainly haven't been using it as long I and others have been using my ##setup.el##.  Which one is it "too late" to rename?  Which library should keep the name, do you think?

Where do we end, if this kind of thing goes on -- no respect/cooperation wrt precedent?  What's to stop others from doing the same (to you)?  Is that the kind of environment/community you want to foster?

If you won't rename, then I guess I'll have to.  "Sadly", indeed.  (Not the end of the world -- but this shouldn't be necessary on my part.)

[I have to say that I think there was a lot more cooperation and mutual respect in the "old days".  People didn't hesitate to acknowledge/reference the slightest borrowing/inspiration etc.  That seems rare now, as if every idea or implementation springs ''sui generis'' from thin air by the artist.  (To be clear: I'm not saying you borrowed anything without attribution.  Just making a more general point about the degree of cooperation I perceive nowadays.)]

I guess what I don't understand, is why anything has to be renamed.  What is the issue with two files coexisting on the internet with the same name?  Obviously I don't want to burden (let alone disrespect) you or your  users, I just don't get the real issue of having a name conflict, if one package is on EmacsWiki and the other one is on ELPA.

I think the answer is obvious.  Just imagine if there were multiple libraries of any other name - available from different sources, whether different GIT repositories or any other locations.

Even you acknowledged such name conflict as "sad" - and indeed it is.  Fortunately, it can be fixed, given the will.  Why did you say that, if you really thought there is no issue?

People have played very well with each other about this kind of thing in the past.  No one tries to name their library the same as another -- in fact, just the opposite.

Just wanted to add to the argument of setup vs setup.el, the name is so generic that honestly either of you should complain about duplicates.

"either" or "neither"? But yes, you are right. I like generic names, which is why I chose setup but I didn't know that Drew had a library with the same name.
