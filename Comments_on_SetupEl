I guess what I don't understand, is why anything has to be renamed.  What is the issue with two files coexisting on the internet with the same name?  Obviously I don't want to burden (let alone disrespect) you or your  users, I just don't get the real issue of having a name conflict, if one package is on EmacsWiki and the other one is on ELPA.
