A major mode for GNU Emacs to handle assembly language source files.

== Description ==

From the project homepage

* The name `gas-mode' is somewhat misleading; <code>gas-mode</code> is
  not more specific to the GNU <code>gas</code> assembler as is the
  current <code>asm-mode</code>, i.e. not at all.  For users of
  <code>asm-mode</code>, a switch to <code>gas-mode</code> should be
  rather painless, at least if your comment character is at its
  standard value, the semicolon (<code>;</code>).  I'm still lacking
  reports about how it works for other comment lead-in characters.
  There are so many assembler syntaxes around, I can't test them all
  under real world conditions.

* <code>gas-mode</code> is a new mode, written from scratch, since
  <code>asm-mode</code> turned out to be not too useful for my needs.
  It handles the usual features like highlighting and proper comment
  handling as you'd expect.  Some of its special features include:

** code rearrangement ("beautifying"): The fill-paragraph command,
   when issued on a code line, will rearrange all fields (columns) in
   the code block around point which are out of position, adjusting
   their locations to fit the (customizable) predefined field start
   columns best.

** comment filling: fill-paragraph, when issued within a comment, will
   recognize the current paragraph and adopt to the comment style when
   the result needs comment lines to be inserted or removed.

** symbol highlighting: when point rests on a symbol which is also
   defined or referenced elsewhere in the same buffer, it gets
   highlighted and you can move forward and backward between its
   definitions and the references with <code>forward-sexp</code> and
   <code>backward-sexp</code>.  This is different from a simple string
   search in that only those places are considered where the symbol
   gets actually used by your code.  For local labels,
   <code>gas-mode</code> resolves which references are associated with
   which location and only highlights and jumps between those that
   fit, even if they're overlapping.  Highlight colors differ for
   different types of references.  Foreground color changes if none or
   more than one definition is available in the current buffer as long
   as point is on such a symbol.

** If you'd like to move C style declarations of assembly language
   functions from a <code>.h</code> file which has to be maintained
   separately into the <code>.S</code> file near the function and let
   make do the rest, have a look at the start of
   <code>gas-mode.el</code> (look for 'C pass-through').  If you're
   targeting a mixed C/Assembler language environment where you get
   disastrous results when your assembler file isn't in sync with its
   <code>.h</code> definitions, or maybe you're already using some
   kind of embedding C definitions into your asm files for later
   extraction -- it's just about proper syntax and symbol
   highlighting, but chances are you'll like it.

== Where to get gas-mode ==

Get gas-mode.el from http://www.hczim.de/software/gas-mode.html

As of at least 2020, the website of Heike C. Zimmerer (the
maintainer), [http://www.hczim.de/ hczim.de], is down.  However, I was
able to find the last published version of gas-mode.el (1.10)
[https://github.com/nelhage/elisp/blob/master/local/gas-mode.el in Nel
Hage's elisp GitHub repository].  I have also since uploaded it to the
Elisp area, Lisp:gas-mode.el, to help preserve it better.
