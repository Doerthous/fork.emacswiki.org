We need some basic tutorial on how to get started using GPG from Emacs before we start talking about using [[GnuPG]] and various email clients.

Here are some ideas from a thread on Mastodon:

* how to create a key for yourself 
* import somebody else's key 
* encrypt a file for unlocking with  your own key
* encrypt a file for unlocking with an imported key
* easily integrate with a linux email client such as Thunderbird or Kmail or Evolution
* what version of gpg is running?
* how to create a passphrase
* how to create, store and use a revocation certificate
* how to set and edit an expiry date in order to extend a key
* explain what those weird subkeys are
* how and where to upload it to public keyservers
* how to extract and send a key to somebody else, knowing their public key
* how to import someone else's key
* how to set trust levels for other's keys
* explain errors that happen when methods using imported keys throw 'unusable key' errors
* encrypt/decrypt
* easy integration

I'm going to start with the text I originally wrote for my
[[Gmail, Gnus and GPG]] page. Let's see how far I get. I'm going to
call it [https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/ugg/about The Using GPG Guide]
(or UGG for shortâ€¦).
