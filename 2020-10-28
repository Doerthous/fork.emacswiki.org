As a fun little side project I’ve been involved in some Gemini-protocol wiki programming and therefore you can “enjoy” a transmogrified Emacs Wiki via gemini://emacswiki.org – one would think that eww is better suited for this, but whenever I visit HTTPS sites using eww, I suffer a two or three second delay. Anyway. Give it a try, if you’re curious.
