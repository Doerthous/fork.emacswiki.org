[[Dired]] is a very useful file manager. Unfortunately it lacks a synchronization command.

[https://github.com/renard/dired-sync dired-sync] is designed to fill that missing feature.

NOTE: 2021: This package was last maintained in year 2014. There exists a MELPA package [https://github.com/stsquad/dired-rsync dired-rsync] under much more current maintenance (2020-12).

== Features ==

* <tt>rsync</tt> and <tt>ssh</tt> based.
* Can synchronize:
** local / local directories.
** local / remote and remote / local directories.
** remote / remote directories
* Optimization for remote / remote directories synchronization.

== Installation ==

drop [https://github.com/renard/dired-sync/blob/master/dired-sync.el dired-sync.el] in your
load-path and bind (suggested) <tt>C-c S</tt> key to <tt>dired-sync</tt>:

{{{
(when (require 'dired-sync nil t)
   (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c S") 'dired-do-sync))
}}}
