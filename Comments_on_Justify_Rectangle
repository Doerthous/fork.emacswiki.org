Cool.  Alternatively, you might consider just binding ##C-x r >##, and having it alternate when repeated: right, left, right... (compare `this-command' with `last-command').

One less key to bind/sacrifice on `C-x r'.  But left-justifying (less common?) would mean one more key to type: `##C-x r > >##'.  Just an idea.
