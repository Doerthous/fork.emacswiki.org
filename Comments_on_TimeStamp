I am working with emacs25 25.2+1-6 amd64, on Linux Mint.
my .emacs file:

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(safe-local-variable-values

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(default ((t (:inherit nil :stipple nil :background "#ffffff" :foreground "#221f1e" :inverse-video ni$

(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)
(setq interprogram-paste-function 'x-cut-buffer-or-selection-value)

(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)

The updating is not working. Do you see any mistakes; or do you have any suggestions?
