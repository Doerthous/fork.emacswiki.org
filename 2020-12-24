I've been making some changes to the wiki engine, adding header, nav, and footer elements instead of using divs with classes. This means that some [[CSS]] files might break in unexpected ways. If you notice anything weird, please let me know by leaving a comment, here.

I also changed the default CSS to automatically pick the dark theme if your browser says it prefers the dark theme. â€“ [[Alex Schroeder]]
