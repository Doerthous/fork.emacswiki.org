Just wanted to say that MH/nmh is the //best// email system I’ve //ever// used.  My quality of life declined sharply when I decided to “upgrade” to IMAP clients.  (It helps that I first encountered MH really early in my Unix days—I got my first account at Syracuse University, and Jerry had worked there and shared the MH Kool-Aid far and wide!)

I can agree with Claire: MH-E is very cute and smooth! It's a shame nmh doesn't have the best documentation; I spent too much time sifting through ancient Wayback links & old mailing list posts before I finally found out how to use it properly (of course, I updated this wiki with those findings). People have told me that "Maildir addresses a lot of the issues that the MH format has", and it makes me wonder how important those issues are. Of course, //that's// a whole other can of worms!
