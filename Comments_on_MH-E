Just wanted to say that MH/nmh is the //best// email system I’ve //ever// used.  My quality of life declined sharply when I decided to “upgrade” to IMAP clients.  (It helps that I first encountered MH really early in my Unix days—I got my first account at Syracuse University, and Jerry had worked there and shared the MH Kool-Aid far and wide!)
