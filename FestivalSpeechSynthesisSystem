There are at least two possibilities (2021-09-07) to use festival with emacs:
* from the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/festival.el wiki] or 
* from the [https://github.com/festvox/festival/blob/master/lib/festival.el festival developers]

In either case, add 

    (push "/path/to/directory/" load-path)
    (require 'festival)

keep the double quotes, and replace the `/path/to/directory' with the appropriate value
