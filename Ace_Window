Ace Window (or <code>ace-window</code>) is an Emacs command which is
designed to improve on and replace Emacs' built-in
<code>other-window</code> command (which by default is bound to
<kbd>C-x o</kbd>) for switching between [EmacsWiki:Window Emacs
Windows].

== How it works ==

When you call the <code>ace-window</code> function (the author
suggests binding this to <kbd>M-o</kbd>, which by default is the
prefix key for various <code>facemenu-*</code>) commands, it will
display a character for each window, and you can move to that window
immediately by typing the character.

There are also a bunch of other commands that make working with
windows easier, like deleting them quickly, and so on.

== Where to find Ace W indow ==
