== Automatic selection of a language ==

The language used on this wiki depends on the language preferences of your browser, and these usually depend on the setup of your operating system.

If you visit http://www.emacswiki.org/ you will see a main page corresponding to your language preferences, if it exists. If it doesn't, you will see the English main page, SiteMap.

See LanguageIdentification for how the language of a page is identified for languge-specific RecentChanges.

Note that all the various languages are in a single wiki. There are not enough non-English pages to warrant a separate wiki.

== How to change default language persistently ==

If you follow the _English_ link on the SiteMap, you should end up on the English script.

== How to translate a page ==

See TranslationHelp.
