When invoked with a keypress, a Self Displaying Keymap displays its
options in a popup.  For example, pressing <C-x> displays the
commands in that keymap, together with the keys to activate the
commands.  A further keypress runs the appropriate command; for
example <C-b> runs command list-buffers, and dismisses the popup.

A further use of these keymaps is display of help information for
both the keymap and any of its commands.  Yet another use is
provision for a user to create personal/project self
displaying keymaps.

The concept of these keymaps is not speculation, but exists in a
code package that has been in use successfully for many years.  If
the idea of seeing a keymap and its options intrigues you (even the
global keymap, although that is not very useful) then download a
slightly modified Emacs 27.1 as described in NavigationShell.  You
need to allocate about an hour, in total, to see what is available.
What is there will be new and different to you; and probably quite
interesting too.
