[[ja:フレーム]]

A '''frame''' contains and displays one or more Emacs internal [[window]]s.

Outside of Emacs, frames are usually called "windows".  The Emacs internal windows would usually be called "panes" or "sub-windows" or "MDI windows" or some other term.  When not otherwise qualified, this wiki uses ''window'' to mean an Emacs internal window.

When running on a GUI (graphical user interface, such as X11, Microsoft Windows, or !MacOS X), each external window provided by the host GUI becomes an Emacs frame.  Creating a new frame in Emacs creates a new host GUI window.

In a character cell terminal (like a text console or an xterm), there is an implicit Emacs frame for the terminal.  Text terminals can still create additional frames, each effectively a "virtual terminal", and cycle between them, using the same commands.

A frame is rectangular, with four ''borders''.  Frames have names, similar to buffers.  On GUIs, the host system usually provides a ''title bar'', showing the FrameTitle.  A frame usually has a MenuBar, just under the title bar.  On GUIs, the frame may also have a ToolBar with icon buttons. 

This wiki is concerned predominantly with Emacs frames.  Not all of the properties of Emacs frames pertain to non-Emacs "windows" (such as your web browser).

== Appearance ==

In this screenshot, colored boxes have been added to identify the frame (red), and three windows (in blue, green, and yellow).

== Behavior ==

A frame can be in one of these states:
* '''visible''' - this really means user-accessible
* '''invisible''' - you cannot access it

A ''visible'' frame can be in one of these states:

* '''raised''' - you can see it and manipulate it
* '''iconified''' (minimized) - you see only a small icon representing the frame

A ''raised'' frame can be maximized, occupying the full screen, or not.  You can resize a frame, drag it around, iconify/minimize it, restore/uniconify, rename it, or delete it.

== Commands and keys ==

Most frame-related [[KeySequence]]s are prefixed with <kbd>C-x 5</kbd>.

|| Key                || Meaning                                           || Command                 ||
|| <kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd> || Switch to '''o'''ther frame                       || ##other-frame##         ||
|| <kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> || Delete current frame (zero/zap)                   || ##delete-frame##        ||
|| <kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd> || Delete other frames (makes this the only ''one'') || ##delete-other-frames## ||
|| <kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd> || Create new frame (from one, become ''two'')       || ##make-frame-command##  ||
|| <kbd>C-x C-z</kbd> || Iconify/minimize frame                            || ##suspend-frame##       ||
|| <kbd>M-F10</kbd>   || Maximize frame                                    || ##toggle-frame-maximized## ||
|| <kbd>F11</kbd>     || Full screen                                       || ##toggle-frame-maximized## ||

Your window manager or operating environment likely provides ways to perform many of these as well.
