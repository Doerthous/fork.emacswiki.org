[[ja:フレーム]]

A '''frame''' contains and displays one or more Emacs [[window]]s.

Outside of Emacs, frames are usually called "windows".

Outside of Emacs, Emacs windows might be called "panes", "sub-windows", or "MDI windows".

When running on a graphic display, an Emacs frame is implemented as a window-manager window.  

In a character-cell terminal (such as a text console or an xterm) there is an implicit Emacs frame for the terminal.  You can create additional frames -- each is in effect a virtual terminal.

A frame is rectangular, with four ''borders''.  On a graphic display, a frame usually has a ''title bar'', showing the FrameTitle.  By default, a frame has a MenuBar, just under the title bar.  On a graphic displays, by default a frame also has a ToolBar with icon buttons. 


== Appearance ==

In this screenshot, colored boxes indicate the frame (red), and three windows (in blue, green, and yellow) in the frame.

== Behavior ==

A frame can be visible (raised), invisible, or iconified (minimized). 

A ''raised'' frame can be maximized, occupying the full screen, or not.  You can resize a frame, drag it around, iconify/minimize it, restore it, rename it, or delete it.

== Commands and keys ==

Most frame-related [[KeySequence]]s are prefixed with <kbd>C-x 5</kbd>.

|| <kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd> || Delete other frames (makes this the only ''one'') || ##delete-other-frames## ||
|| <kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd> || Create new frame (from one, become ''two'')       || ##make-frame-command##  ||
|| <kbd>C-x C-z</kbd> || Iconify/minimize frame                            || ##suspend-frame##       ||

Your window manager or operating environment likely provides ways to perform many of these as well.
