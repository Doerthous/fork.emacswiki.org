A quick and dirty way to replace all notepad.exe calls would be to use the Registry:

1. Start [tt]regedit.exe[/tt]

2. Go to [tt]HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options[/tt]

3. Add a new key named [tt]notepad.exe[/tt]

4. Add (in there) a new string named [tt]Debugger[/tt] and use this value: [tt]emacsclientw.exe -na runemacs.exe -F[/tt]

Note that this will pretty much break the usual "-F" behavior but it is needed as Emacsclientw has no [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2984846/set-image-file-execution-options-will-always-open-the-named-exe-file-as-defaul -z parameter] (yet).

I know this is a pretty old post, but maybe someone will find this useful. for the debugger value this works much better 
emacsclientw.exe -c -a runemacs.exe -F "%1"
if you leave off the "%1" then it wont open the file you click.

The powershell script for setting up the server upon startup doesn't seem to be working. What worked for me is:
{{{
# Path to startup file
$startup_file = "$([Environment]::GetFolderPath('Startup'))\StartEmacsServer.bat"

# Introduce variable HOME:
# 1. for simplicity
# 2. runemacs.exe expects it to be
#
# %APPDATA% is chosen because runemacs.exe operates there

#	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/General-Variables.html#General-Variables
New-Item $startup_file -type file
Set-Content -Path $startup_file -Value "set HOME=%APPDATA%"

# Clean previous server file info first
Add-Content -Path $startup_file -Value "del /Q ""%HOME%/.emacs.d/server/*"""
Add-Content -Path $startup_file -Value "runemacs.exe --daemon"
}}}

For me on two Windows 10 machines, the description in the section "Create a shortcut" does not work.
What does work is to add an environment variable

ALTERNATE_EDITOR=/path/to/runemacs.exe

and put emacsclientw.exe in the task bar and as the program to use for desired file types.

Update:
My /path/to contains a blank which causes problems. (Namely emacs opens the desired file and the part after the blank as another one...)

To heal that:

# Make sure the system variable PATH contains /path/to.
# Put ALTERNATE_EDITOR=runemacs.exe
