I have written several things for GnuEmacs. 

* org-publish.el adds website-publishing management support to OrgMode. It is now part of the OrgMode distribution.
* Cell Mode is a weird spreadsheet thing that I am currently rewriting. https://gitlab.com/dto/cell-mode  
* A cell mode screenshot: http://xelf.me/cell.png
* Cell Mode is part of EmacsMosaic/SchemeMosaic: https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el
