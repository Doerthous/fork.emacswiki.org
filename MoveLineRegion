1 May 2022: This often causes the error: "command-execute: The mark is not set now, so there is no region". A more robust and less complicated approach is given by: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MoveText (Emacs should really provide this functionality by default and let users configure if they want the region to expand automatically or not.) 

These, in combination with MoveLine and MoveRegion, provide behavior similar to Eclipse's Alt-Up/Down.  They use MoveLine if there is no active [[region]], MoveRegion if there is.  Note that unlike in Eclipse, the [[region]] will not expand to the beginning of the first line or the end of the last line, see the [https://github.com/targzeta/move-lines move-lines] package for this.
