== Overview ==

XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Calls) is a protocol for remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be transmitted, processed and returned.

The spec can be found at http://www.xmlrpc.com/.

== xml-rpc.el ==

This is an XML-RPC client implementation in Emacs Lisp, capable of both
synchronous and asynchronous method calls (using the url package's async
retrieval functionality).

xml-rpc.el represents XML-RPC datatypes as lisp values, automatically
converting to and from the XML datastructures as needed, both for method
parameters and return values, making using XML-RPC methods fairly
transparent to the Lisp code.

You can install it via [[MELPA]] or find the source code here:

=== Comments ===

It could probably be useful for communicating with EmacsWiki using the
MeatBall:XmlRpcToWiki API.  See the WikiRemote for further discussion
on the topic.  -- DanielLundin
