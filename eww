Eww (the <b>E</b>acs <b>W</b>eb <b>W</b>owser) is a Web browser written in elisp and based on shr.el.  It is included in Emacs 24.4 and later.  It supports some basic CSS and HTML5.

== Configuration ==

Eww uses the `shr' HTML renderer, so we can change how Eww web pages look by setting the shr variables.

<pre>
(setq
 browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url ; Use eww as the default browser
 shr-use-fonts  nil                          ; No special fonts
 shr-use-colors nil                          ; No colours
 shr-indentation 2                           ; Left-side margin
 shr-width 70                                ; Fold text to 70 columns
 eww-search-prefix "https://ddg.gg/html?q=") ; Use DuckDuckGo for search (default)
</pre>

== Usage ==

You can start Eww with `M-x eww'. You'll be asked to enter a search term or URL.

You can see a list of keyboard bindings with `?', but here are a few you might want:

* `TAB' - Next link
* <code>Shift+TAB</code> - Previous link
* `b' - Add bookmark
* `B' - View bookmarks
* `d' - Download link under point
* `l' - Go back
* `r' - Go forward
* `H' - View history
* `g' - reload the page
* `G' - Enter a new URL or search
* `R' - Attempt to improve readability
* `w' - Copy the current URL
* <code>M-<RET></code> - Open link in new tab
* `s' - Get a list of eww tabs

== Windows ==

Make sure that libxml2 and GnuTLS are installed and that the executables and DLLs can be found by EMACS. You may add their location to <code>%PATH%</code>. The aforementioned packages are provided by [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ ezwinports] or [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25-i686-deps.zip Emacs (25, 32-bit)] (same [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25-x86_64-deps.zip for 64 bit]).

You may also need to install TLS certificates, as explained in Magnus’ article [http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html “how to enable GnuTLS for Emacs 24 on Windows”].
