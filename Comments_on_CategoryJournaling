* EevMode -- e-script lets you keep an EXECUTABLE diary! VERY COOL!

[new]
/While I have no doubt whatsoever, that one can implement a diary within the e-script environment, using eev-mode or not, I feel inclined to state that neither on the EevMode page of this wiki, nor on the eev-mode or e-script project homepage there is anything written about such subject.  The same way one could add a link here to a perl script reposatory, saying there is a way to create a diary with perl somehow./  --QirbCameled

Writing diary in e-script enables us to replay operations.
I think it is VERY IMPORTANT to take a note of commands when you learn computers.
eev-mode is only a minor-mode to execute shell commands in Emacs, so it is orthogonal with other major-modes for journal. -- [[Anonymous]]

It seems to me that there are many such commands, potentially useful for many tasks, including keeping a journal.  To list them all on this page would diminish the value of this category, however. -- AlexSchroeder

Nathan Weizenbaum wrote a nice [http://nex3.leeweiz.net/posts/25-how-i-wrote-an-emacs-blog-client-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale blog post] about the experience of hacking up an Emacs client for his blog with TextileMode and HttpPost. -- EdwardOConnor

* Organize and clean up the page ?

This page is really getting messy mixing real CategoryJournaling tools
with CategoryChatClient or other tools. It is time to take a decision
and leave here qualified tool. Opinions ? -- XavierMaillard
