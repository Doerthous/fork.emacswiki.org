How do i mark selected unstaged changes and commit them? -- VagnJohansen 2012-02-06 09:59 UTC

Unfortunately there's currently no multiple selection for magit items

Many commands, iincluding the *unstaging* command, now act on the items in the region. Please try Magit's *next* branch.

Where is the section for signing git commit with gpg key? 

Three things:

1) I do not want to disturb my actual system setting for this ,becasue Emacs is "yet another software" on my device.

2) This is such a de facto standard and it is badly missing (docs and features) 

3) While trying to commit with sign  (--s choose from the transient pop) ...it is taking way long ...press $ and it is saying " Waiting for the editor to close .....gpg failed to sign data...etc"

Heads up! gpg key is perfectly wotking on other app inside emacs(GUI/Environment) ,i.e I can sign and encrypt my mail in mu4e or Gnus , no problem whatsoever. But...this damn thing is failing me.

I am wondering nobody encounter this problem???? Hard to believe!, if anybody did ..where is precise and explicit docs of it???

Resolved it doing the suggestion provided by someone at Reddit emacs space ...just need to add one entry in gpg-agent.conf file i.e

allow-emacs-pinentry

and Start the pinentry-start service ....voila!
