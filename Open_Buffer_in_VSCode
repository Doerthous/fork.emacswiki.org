== Open Buffer In VS Code ==

The following elisp can be used to open the current buffer in VSCode, this is particularly useful for previewing markdown:

{{{

(defun my-open-current-file-in-vscode ()
  (interactive)

 (save-window-excursion

  (async-shell-command
                                       
   (format "code --add ~/Notes/MD/notes --goto %S:%d"
           (shell-quote-argument buffer-file-name)
           (+ (if (bolp) 1 0) (count-lines 1 (point)))
           ))))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c v") 'my-open-current-file-in-vscode)

}}}

Alternatively if you wanted to simply preview markdown marktext could be used instead:


{{{

(defun my-open-current-file-in-marktext ()
  (interactive)

 (save-window-excursion

  (async-shell-command
   (format "marktext %S"
           (shell-quote-argument buffer-file-name)))))
}}}
