[[fr:Custom_Themes]]
A '''[::custom theme]''' is a package that sets lots of [[Face|faces]] and variables for you. 
This page collects reviews and recommendations of the various custom themes out there.

These are all implemented using [[CustomThemes|custom themes]].

(There is a separate [[ColorThemes|color-theme.el]] package, which installs themes by modifying Emacs faces directly instead of using the /custom theme/ ([[Customize]]) framework. It hasn't been updated much since 2009, and now it is more common to use /custom themes/. See [[CustomThemes#ComparedToColorThemes|comparing color theme and custom theme]] for a comparison of the two.)

* [[PinkBliss|Pink Bliss]] -- everything is pink, what's not to like? 
* [[Brutalist Theme]] -- trying to use as few colors as possible
