This page reads like an advertisement, I get the feeling it should be rewritten and some connection to Emacs should be established.

What PhilipKaludercic said.  The most important part of the request, IMO, is to please point out a connection with Emacs.  Otherwise, it reads like just a description of a software tool or platform, with no relation to Emacs.  Thx.

Yeah. I agree with you. I was actually intending to point to the discussion on the ML about using it for Emacs development, and that it was an alternative to Github. If the idea does not have merit the page can be removed.
