This page reads like an advertisement, I get the feeling it should be rewritten and some connection to Emacs should be established.

What PhilipKaludercic said.  The most important part of the request, IMO, is to please point out a connection with Emacs.  Otherwise, it reads like just a description of a software tool or platform, with no relation to Emacs.  Thx.

Yeah. I agree with you. I was actually intending to point to the discussion on the ML about using it for Emacs development, and that it was an alternative to Github. If the idea does not have merit the page can be removed.

@[shrysr]: Please use your judgment to determine whether something can be included on the wiki about this.  And if so, please edit the page to convey that useful info.  Thx.

srht does offer a number of services that can integrate well with emacs (ML hosting/control, source control, wiki<->orgmode, etc), even the site itself sort of "screams" to be browsed via Emacs as well lol

I'd give a +1 to it's usefulness here
