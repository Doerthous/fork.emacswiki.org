This page reads like an advertisement, I get the feeling it should be rewritten and some connection to Emacs should be established.

What PhilipKaludercic said.  The most important part of the request, IMO, is to please point out a connection with Emacs.  Otherwise, it reads like just a description of a software tool or platform, with no relation to Emacs.  Thx.
