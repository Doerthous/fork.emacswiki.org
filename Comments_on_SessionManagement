I tried desktopaid at April 2013 in 23.1.1. I downloaded the package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/desktopaid/.  
The package has desktopaid.elc but is compiled for older version of emacs so it wont work. 
Trying with desktopaid.el emacs opened with no error but i couldnt use it. Firstly i was getting an error about a missing .desktopaid folder, but even after it didnt work as expected.

I've been using workgroups (workgroups2) for the past few months and haven't looked back.

I tried *desktopaid* at April 2013 in 23.1.1. I downloaded the package from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/desktopaid/ source page]. The package has desktopaid.elc but it's compiled for older version of emacs so it wont work. Trying with desktopaid.el emacs opened with no error. So i changed a little the proposed .emacs lines and i added:
<pre>
;; desktopaid
(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/" load-path))
(autoload 'dta-hook-up "desktopaid.el" "Desktop Aid" t)
(dta-hook-up)
</pre>
*In short: Across sessions -- Frames: OK,  Windows:No , Directories:No* 
What you should pay attention to :
Starting first time emacs with desktopaid enabled we will be asked 'Select configuration:' If we proceed with just an Enter, then in trying to close emacs will error that there is no .desktopaid dir.  So create the ~/.desktopaid dir first and give a name of the configuration file when asked at the start.
Generally i wouldnt recommended for new emacs users since it seems not-maintained and tricky to set-up correctly. Unless ofcourse the functionality is needed.

I use EmacsSession, because it doesn't reload all the files and doesn't require a lot of customization like DeskTop does. -- AlexSchroeder
