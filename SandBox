This is the original:  / .emacs/ and it doesn't italicize correctly
This is what I think it needs to be:  ./emacs/ but maybe this will work /.emacs/


However, I can't get it to actually work.  Either it's broken or the docs are misleading, or I just haven't had enough coffee today.


[new] /You haven't had enough coffee!/ (Or perhaps your search engine is also under-caffeinated.)

As of Emacs 24.3, the current working directory is no longer on the <code>desktop-path</code> by default. Refer to the release notes in [https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-release/blob/adfd5933358fdf6715423dee8169eb3cd7d982db/etc/NEWS#L1725 etc/NEWS]

If you add the following to your <code>.emacs</code> file, the cd-into-your-desktop-containing-directory technique will work:

<pre>
(setq desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/" "~" "."))
</pre>

[new] 

These commands do work, but it's inconvenient to manually enter them every time.  I have to start emacs with --no-desktop (which is trivial) and then execute desktop-change-dir and then desktop-save-mode to activate desktop-save-mode.

: indent 1

:: indent 2

::: indent 3

I think what never worked was to intermix these.

* foo
: bar
* foo
: bar

Works.

* foo
** bar
:: baz

This doesn't work as expected because "baz" is the first item of a definition list.

* foo\\
bar

* foo
\\bar

* foo\\bar

------

* A foo is not the same as a bar.\\\\
A bar is much smaller than a foo.
* A tata is longer than a toto.\\
But a toto is deeper than a tata.
