That way C-h and M-h behave like the backwards version of C-d and M-d, and help is available with a single press of backspace key.

key-translation-map takes care of different functions of backspace key in different modes. For example, backspace key runs [Info-scroll-down] in Info mode and [delete-backward-char] in text mode.

The above is tested with Emacs 29, both in pure GTK mode and in alacritty terminal emulator. I'm using sway window manager with X disabled.

To use C-h as backward-delete-char in other GTK programs, use

 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme "Emacs"

It is unclear how to achieve the same with QT programs.
