Emacs has a daunting learning curve, especially if you don't even know what to look for.

Aside from asking questions over [InternetRelayChat IRC] (#emacs on irc.libera.chat), the [https://discord.me/emacs Emacs Discord], EmacsStackExchange, or in the appropriate mailing lists, you can also reach out to people who offer Emacs coaching services.
