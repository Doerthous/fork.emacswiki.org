Emacs has a daunting learning curve, especially if you don't even know what to look for.

Aside from asking questions over [InternetRelayChat IRC] (#emacs on irc.libera.chat), the [https://discord.me/emacs Emacs Discord], EmacsForums, or in the appropriate mailing lists, you can also reach out to people who offer Emacs coaching services. [https://www.codementor.io/search/mentors?q=emacs CodeMentor lists a number of people]. In addition, there's:

* [https://www.sanityinc.com/ Steve Purcell]: maintainer of MELPA ([https://www.codementor.io/@sanityinc CodeMentor profile])
* [[Leo Vivier]]: co-maintainer of Org Roam; offers coaching in Org Mode, Org Roam, and other topics
* ... (please add yourself if you offer coaching)

https://meet.jit.si/ can be a quick way to set up a web conference and share your screen.
