== Applying frames and windows ==

Both frames and windows can be used to organize your Emacs activity.  For example, you might have one frame for working with SQL, divided into two windows: One editing a query file, and a second showing the results of the query.  You might have another for Gnus, with three windows: Summary, article, and BBDB info.  You might have a third frame for chatting on IRC, with all your channels visible in separate windows.

The keyboard can be used to navigate frames and windows, but so can the mouse.  You can have Emacs select windows just by pointing at them; see [[Manual:focus follows mouse]] in the Emacs manual.  Note that text-only terminals can still have multiple frames, with the same key sequences and commands.

You can organize your frames and windows into configurations.  You can then save, restore, and switch between them, to correspond with your activities.  See WindowConfiguration and FrameConfiguration.  You can have Emacs use frames instead of windows whenever possible; see OneOnOneEmacs.
