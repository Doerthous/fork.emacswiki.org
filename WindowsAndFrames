Emacs displays information in [[frame]]s containing [[window]]s.  Every window shows the contents of a [[buffer]].  Buffers contain the content you are working with in Emacs.

== Terminology ==

Emacs terminology differs significantly from mainstream computing usage on what ''window'' means.

|| Emacs  || Mainstream || Remarks                          ||
|| frame  || window     || Top-level Emacs display element  ||
|| window || pane       || Contained within a frame         ||
|| buffer || document   || The content you are working with ||


In this screenshot, colored boxes have been added to identify the frame (red), and three windows (in blue, green, and yellow).

== Parts of an Emacs Frame ==

[[image:FrameCalloutsScreenShot]]

At the top of the frame is a '''title bar''' ['''A'''].  This is provided by the window manager, not Emacs, but you can set the FrameTitle that appears there.

Below the title bar is a MenuBar ['''B'''].  Click `mouse-1' on a menu name (##File##, ##Edit##, ##Options##, and so on) to open a pull-down menu.  Some of the menus available depend on the current [[mode]].

Below the menu bar is a ToolBar ['''C'''].  Each icon corresponds to a single, frequently used command.  Like the menu bar, the tool bar can change with the mode.

The frame shown here is divided into three windows: ['''D'''], ['''F'''], ['''K'''].  The windows have a white background.  Each window shows a different [[buffer]].  Here, each buffer is visiting a file, but buffers need not visit files.  A buffer can appear in multiple windows, or not at all.

Each window has its own ModeLine at the bottom: ['''E'''], ['''G'''], ['''L'''].  In this screenshot, the mode-lines have a darker gray background.  A mode-line typically reflects information about the buffer in its window.

At the bottom of the frame is the MiniBuffer ['''H'''].  Emacs uses the minibuffer to read input.  All windows in a frame share the same minibuffer. The EchoArea, which displays output, uses the same space as the minibuffer.

Each window can have its own ScrollBar -- see ['''N'''] for window ['''F'''].  The scroll bar reflects the TextCursor position ([[point]]) in the buffer. You can drag the scroll bar with a mouse to quickly move through the buffer.

By default, each window also has a [[fringe]], at the left ['''P'''] or right ['''R'''] (or both) edges.  Things such as line wrap can be indicated by glyphs in the fringe.

== Commands and Keys ==

[[Frame]]s, [[window]]s, and [[buffer]]s all have their own commands and KeySequences.  

Here are some common commands for windows:

|| Window           || Frame || Meaning                                                 ||
|| <kbd>C-x o</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd> || Switch to '''o'''ther                      ||
|| <kbd>C-x 0</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> || Delete current (zero/zap)                  ||
|| <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd> || Delete others (make this the only ''one'') ||
|| <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd> || Create new (was one, now ''two'')          ||

== Using Frames and Windows ==

Both frames and windows can be used to organize your Emacs activity.  For example, you might have one frame for working with [SqlMode SQL], divided into two windows: One editing a query file, and a second showing the results of the query.  You might have another for [[Gnus]], with three windows: Summary, article, and [[BBDB]] info.  You might have a third frame for chatting on [InternetRelayChat IRC], with all your channels visible in separate windows.

You can use the keyboard or a mouse to navigate among frames and windows.  On some platforms you can select a window just by hovering the mouse over it -- see [[Manual:focus follows mouse]].  

You can organize your frames and windows into configurations.  You can save, restore, and switch between configurations -- see WindowConfiguration and FrameConfiguration.
