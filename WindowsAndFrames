Emacs displays information in [[frame]]s containing [[window]]s.  Every window shows the contents of a [[buffer]].  Buffers contain the content you are editing/viewing in Emacs.

== Terminology ==

Emacs terminology differs significantly from mainstream computing usage on what ''window'' means.

|| Emacs  || Mainstream || Remarks                          ||
|| frame  || window     || Top-level Emacs display element  ||
|| window || pane       || Contained within a frame         ||
|| buffer || document   || The content you are working with ||

When not otherwise qualified, this wiki uses ''window'' to mean an Emacs internal window.

== Appearance ==

This screenshot shows Emacs 27.2 (circa 2021), running on Microsoft Windows.  Three windows are shown, each a buffer visiting a file.

== Components ==

At the top of the frame is a '''title bar''' ['''A'''].  This is provided by the host operating environment, not Emacs.  The FrameTitle text appears here.

Below the title bar is a MenuBar ['''B'''].  Each menu (##File##, ##Edit##, ##Options##, and so on) will yield a pull-down menu when clicked.  Additional menus may appear depending on the [[mode]]s in effect.

Below the menu bar is a ToolBar ['''C'''].  Each icon corresponds to a single, frequently-used command.  Like the menu bar, the tool bar can change with modes.

This frame is divided into three windows: ['''D'''], ['''F'''], ['''K'''].  Each window is showing a different buffer.  Each buffer is visiting a file.  Buffers can appear in multiple windows, or not at all, and buffers can contain many more things than just files.

Each window has its own ModeLine at the bottom: ['''E'''], ['''G'''], ['''L'''].  The mode line reflects pertinent information about the corresponding window and buffer.

At the bottom of the frame is the MiniBuffer ['''H'''].  Emacs uses the minibuffer for prompts and messages to you.  All windows share the same minibuffer.

Each window has its own ScrollBar, such as ['''N'''] for window ['''F'''].  The scroll bar reflects the current position in the buffer, and can be used to quickly move through the buffer using the mouse.

Each window also has a [[fringe]], appearing at the left ['''P'''] and right ['''R'''] edges.  Things like line wrap can be indicated by glyphs in the fringe.

== Commands and keys ==

[[Frame]]s, [[window]]s, and [[buffer]]s all have their own commands and KeySequences, which are described on their individual pages.  However, the major commands for windows and frames follow a pattern that is worth noting:

|| Window           || Frame || Meaning                                                 ||
|| <kbd>C-x o</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd> || Switch to '''o'''ther                      ||
|| <kbd>C-x 0</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> || Delete current (zero/zap)                  ||
|| <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd> || Delete others (make this the only ''one'') ||
|| <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> || <kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd> || Create new (was one, now ''two'')          ||

== Applying frames and windows ==

Both frames and windows can be used to organize your Emacs activity.  For example, you might have one frame for working with SQL, divided into two windows: One editing a query file, and a second showing the results of the query.  You might have another for Gnus, with three windows: Summary, article, and BBDB info.  You might have a third frame for chatting on IRC, with all your channels visible in separate windows.

The keyboard can be used to navigate frames and windows, but so can the mouse.  You can have Emacs select windows just by pointing at them; see [[Manual:focus follows mouse]] in the Emacs manual.  Note that text-only terminals can still have multiple frames, with the same key sequences and commands.

You can organize your frames and windows into configurations.  You can then save, restore, and switch between them, to correspond with your activities.  See WindowConfiguration and FrameConfiguration.  You can have Emacs use frames instead of windows whenever possible; see OneOnOneEmacs.
