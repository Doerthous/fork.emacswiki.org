[[SachaChua|Sacha Chua]] wrote a blog post where she said: “I’d love to make all these wonderful posts and tutorials and videos more findable. Not just EmacsConf, but also the wonderful things that cross our radar in EmacsNews. I think the EmacsWiki could be a great way to do that. Imagine if people took the links from Emacs News and organized them under various topic pages (and maybe even in some kind of logical order) so that people could come across them… And when we start organizing the resources that are out there, we can map the things people want to learn (ooh! skill trees!) and then see where the missing pieces are.” – [https://sachachua.com/blog/2020/12/emacsconf-2020-emacs-news-highlights/ EmacsConf 2020: Emacs News Highlights and a wishlist]

I'd love to see this as well! 😃 – Alex
