So few of the impenetrable castles of JavaScript that pass for the "modern web" nowadays will so much as load if you have that cancer disabled.

Not to mention the control freaks' insistence on positively identifying every single one of their subjects, discriminating against VPNs, and on and on.

%%EmacsWiki%%, on the other hand, feels so comfy, like your favorite old pair of shoes!

So glad to be here.

Finally decided to contribute my first edit, after lurking for several years.  Got side tracked last night reading all the drama from a couple years ago, at the end of which I was only even more convinced of the need to contribute here (instead of *that other* wiki -- which seems pretty dead these days, by the way).

Cheers!
