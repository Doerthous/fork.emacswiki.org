I am currently a systems engineer in Radar at JPL.  I have worked on a variety of astrophysics, astronomy and planetary science projects including [http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/ NuSTAR], a hard x-ray telescope,  [http://megasims.ess.ucla.edu MegaSIMS], a mass spectrometer for the [http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/ Genesis Mission], the [https://pfs.ipmu.jp/ SuMIRE Prime Focus Spectrograph] for the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, the Terminal Descent Sensor for [https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/ Perseverence], and the [https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/ Surface Water Ocean Topography] (SWOT) mission.

I started using emacs as an undergrad in 1990 or 1991.  I get sucked in deeper every year.  So I guess this means that "I use Emacs."
