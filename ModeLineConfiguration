The Emacs ModeLine is configurable, offering special modes and functions that change its functionality.

Similar to the mode line are the HeaderLine (at the top of internal Emacs windows) and the FrameTitle (the title of the external window in GUI environments).

== Standard minor modes ==

Display of some information in the mode line is governed by these standard minor modes (included in Emacs).  Repeat a command to toggle on and off as needed, or place in your InitFile to turn it on by default.

* `display-time-mode' -- Enable the display of the current time, see DisplayTime
* `line-number-mode' -- Enable or disable the display of the current line number, see also LineNumbers
* `column-number-mode' -- Enable or disable the display of the current column number
* `size-indication-mode' (for Emacs 22 and up) -- Enable or disable the current buffer size, Emacs 22 and later, see Manual:size-indication-mode
* `display-battery-mode' -- Enable or disable laptop battery information, see DisplayBatteryMode.

== Easy Customization ==

There is an interactive [[CustomizingAndSaving Customization]] group for the mode line.  In the standard menus, find `Options -> Customize Emacs -> Top-level Customization Group`, and then navigate to `Environment -> Mode Line`.

== Enhancements ==

There are a number of enhancements particular to the mode line:

* ModeLineMinorModeMenu -- Pop up minor-mode menus from the mode-line.
* ModeLinePosition -- Display region size if region is active (in TransientMarkMode) and highlights the column number if greater than `modelinepos-column-limit'.  
* ModeLinePosAtBeginning -- Display line and column numbers at the start of the mode line, so they are visible even when the TextCursor is inside a function with a long name.
* HideModeLine -- Save screen real estate by hiding the mode line.
* LunarModeLine -- Display current lunar phase in the modeline.
* ModeLineDirtrack -- show the buffer's current directory in the mode-line.
* SmlModeLine -- Indicate in the mode-line, in a scrollbar-like way, the portion of the buffer that is visible in the window.
* ShowPointMode -- Show value of point in the mode-line.
* [[wcMode]] -- Show character/word/line count in mode-line
* NyanMode -- Indicate your position in the buffer in the mode line, with a little help from [WikiPedia:Nyan_Cat Nyan Cat].
* PowerLine -- How to make VIM-like [https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline powerline].
* SmartModeLine -- Smart, sexy, and space efficient mode line. [https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/smart-mode-line/]
* Spaceline -- [https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline modeline from Spacemacs]
* Doom modeline -- [https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline modeline from Doom emacs]
* OcticonsModeLine -- Nice icons in the mode line thanks to the [https://github.com/rougier/emacs-octicons octicons] font.

== Manual Customization ==

Customize the mode line by altering the `mode-line-format' variable.  HideModeLine by setting `mode-line-format' to `nil'.  The mode line is [[buffer]]-specific, meaning that the same buffer has the same mode line in different windows.


* '''string''' -- A string appears verbatim, except for %-constructs embedded in the string
* '''symbol''' -- A LISP symbol stands for its value.  The symbols `t` and `nil' are ignored, as are any symbols whose value is void.
* '''(string rest...)''', '''(list rest...)''' -- A list whose first element is a string or list means to process all the elements recursively and concatenate the results. This is the most common form of mode-line construct.

See also [[Manual:Mode Line Format]] in the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual

=== Example ===

The mode line normally looks something like this:

    -u:**-F1  *scratch*   All L12    (Lisp Interaction)-------%-

As an example, to make it like this:

    Lisp Interaction: buffer *scratch*, line 5 -- user: alice

One might use:

    (setq mode-line-format
          (list
           ;; value of `mode-name'
           "%m: "
           ;; value of current buffer name
           "buffer %b, "
           ;; value of current line number
           "line %l "
           "-- user: "
           ;; value of user
           (getenv "USER")))
