Hello! My name is Benjamin Scott; most people (myself included) just call me "Ben".  I live in the state of New Hampshire, in the north-east region of the United States of America.

I use Emacs (GNU) for more-involved work, and I use jmacs (JoeEditor) for quick edits.

I've been a long-time editor over at Wikipedia, where I'm known as WikiPedia:User:DragonHawk.
