''Description from the official web site'' http://www.beanshell.org/

BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with
object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell
executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to
obvious scripting commands and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted
objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and
JavaScript™.

You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and
debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your applications.

It is used by the JavaDevelopmentEnvironment.
