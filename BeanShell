''Description from the official web site'' http://www.beanshell.org/

BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object
scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell executes standard Java
statements and expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands and
syntax. BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures like those
in Perl and JavaScript(tm).

You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and debugging or as
a simple scripting engine for your applications.

It is used by the JavaDevelopmentEnvironment.
