!GccEmacs refers to the ##feature/native-comp## branch of Emacs, which adds support for compiling EmacsLisp to native code by leveraging ##libgccjit##. All of the Elisp packages shipped with Emacs are native-compiled during the build process, providing a noticeable performance improvement out-of-the-box. Third-party and user modules may also be compiled to achieve further performance improvements.

The official development log can be found on [http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html the gccemacs page].

The feature is discussed in detail in the talk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKHYZOAc_bQ "Bringing GNU Emacs to native code"].

== Installation ==

=== ArchLinux ===

An ##emacs-native-comp-git## package is available [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emacs-native-comp-git/ on the AUR].

Install it with your favourite AUR helper, or use the following commands to do it yourself:

    $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/emacs-native-comp-git.git
    $ cd emacs-native-comp-git
    $ makepkg --syncdeps --install

=== Guix ===

An ##emacs-native-comp## package is available [https://github.com/flatwhatson/guix-channel in this channel].

Add the channel to your ~/.config/guix/channels.scm, or use the following commands to install it as a one-off:

    $ git clone https://github.com/flatwhatson/guix-channel.git
    $ guix install --load-path=./guix-channel emacs-native-comp

=== Nix ===

An emacsGcc package is available from the Nix community's [https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay Emacs overlay].

Detailed installation instructions are available [https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549 in this Gist].

=== Manual ===

To build the native-comp branch of Emacs, you will need ##libgccjit## in addition to the other dependencies described in BuildingEmacs.

First, checkout the ##feature/native-comp## branch of Emacs, and configure it with the ##--with-nativecomp## flag:

    $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
    $ cd emacs
    $ git checkout feature/native-comp
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ './configure --with-nativecomp

You should see "Does Emacs have native lisp compiler? yes" near the end of the configure output if native compilation has been enabled. Complete the build with ##make## and ##make install## as usual.
