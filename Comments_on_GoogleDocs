What announcement?  I just see a 404 page.

I see: "8 June 2015: GoogleCL is currently broken due to the OAuth1 turndown, and likely to remain so. Thanks for your support over the years, and apologies for the lack of prior notice."

Anyways, I removed all information on GoogleCL, since the rewrite also seems defunct. All code was removed in February 2019 due to being broken and nothing has happened since.  Here's a link to the rewrite in case it takes off again: https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl
