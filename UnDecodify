*undecodify.el* is a small bit of elisp written by LarsMagneIngebrigtsen, which fixes a problem often encountered on Wordpress where UTF-8 input text characters are wrongly interpreted as Windows CP-1252 (also known as “code page 1252” or “Windows-1252”) characters and then output as UTF-8.

It's basically when a string like: “it’s” turns into: “itâ€™s”.

You can call undecodify.el like this:

{{{
(undecodify "itâ€™s")
}}}

Which will then output:

{{{
"it’s"
}}}
