I got two reports to day of people trying to edit Emacs Wiki pages who couldn't save. Oops! The monitoring I have just checks whether the wiki itself is reachable, from the same server, and apparently that just kept on working.
Let's hope the restart fixed it.

Hah, apparently not! The problem was that I had decided some days ago that a 10s timeout was a good idea for the wiki. After 10s, the process is terminated. Sadly, if it was saving a page in those 10s, it would leave a lock behind. And before attempting to remove stale locks it would wait, you guessed it, more than 10s! Oh well...

If you run into this, don't hesitate to [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact contact me].
