I got two reports to day of people trying to edit Emacs Wiki pages who couldn't save. Oops! The monitoring I have just checks whether the wiki itself is reachable, from the same server, and apparently that just kept on working.
Let's hope the restart fixed it.

If you run into this, don't hesitate to [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact contact me].
