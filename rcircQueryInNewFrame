I want query windows to pop up a new frame in [[rcirc]].

Here is what I'd normally use:

<pre>
(defun buffer-mode (buffer-or-string)
  ;; This function was snarfed from Stack Exchange.
  "Returns the major mode associated with a buffer."
  (with-current-buffer buffer-or-string
     major-mode))

(defun query-pred (buf act)
  "Predicate to check it is an rcirc-buffer that starts with a
normal letter, not an & or a #. Because I only want to match
query conversations "
  ;; FIXME Add more magic to exclude server buffers too.
  (and
   (eql 'rcirc-mode (buffer-mode buf))
   (string-match "^[a-zA-Z]" buf)))

;; Then as per normal display-buffer-alist usage:
(push
 (cons 'query-pred display-buffer--other-frame-action)
 display-buffer-alist)
</pre>

But, rcirc doesn't respect the normal display-buffer stuff. (A bug?)

Here is a quick workaround for that that seems to work:

<pre>
(defun display-and-return (bon)
  (display-buffer bon)
  bon)

(advice-add 'rcirc-get-buffer-create :filter-return #'display-and-return)
</pre>
It can't be a long term solution because [[AdviceVsHooks]].
