Who wants a new theme? Should we redesign the CSS? Do you want the old logo back?

Personally, I don’t care enough about the logo and I don’t want to spend too much time on CSS fiddling. And you can always switch themes on an individual basis on the [[CSS]] page. So I guess I’m looking for somebody who both feels strongly about and will take it upon themselves to do what [[BrianBurns|Brian Burns]] did for us, years ago ([https://github.com/bburns/emacswiki-light-theme got repo]).
