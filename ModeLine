The '''[::mode line]''' appears at the bottom of every Emacs internal [[window]].  It has useful summary information about the [[buffer]] shown in the window, including its name and current [[mode]]s.

Like the rest of Emacs, you can [[ModeLineConfiguration|configure the mode line]] to look and behave however you want.

The Emacs user manual has an explanation of the [[Manual:Mode Line]], and the technical manual explains the internal [[Manual:Mode Line Format]].

== Appearance ==

This screenshot shows Emacs 27.1 (circa 2020).  Three internal Emacs windows are present, each with a mode line at the bottom.  The mode lines use black text on a grey/silver background.  The main parts of the window use a white background.

== Components ==

The standard components of the mode line, from left to right, are as follows.

: ''References to the screenshot above are given in indented italics, with the callouts in [square brackets].''

=== Human language ===

The first part of the mode line is concerned with human language details (as opposed to programming languages).

If a special input methods is active, it may be indicated first, depending on your terminal type.

Next comes the coding system of the buffer -- one or more characters, indicating how different human languages are encoded as bytes.  The most common are:

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##-## || No code conversion, except possibly end-of-line translation ||
|| ##=## || No code conversion ''or'' end-of-line translation ||
|| ##1## || ISO Latin 1 code conversion ||
|| ##U## || Unicode (typically UTF-8) ||

: ''The file ##short-unicode## contains Unicode text ['''A'''].  The other two have no translation (aside from end-of-line).''

See [[Manual:International|International Character Set Support]] in the Emacs manual for details on all this.

=== End-of-line ===

Next in the mode line is an indication of how the file represents EndOfLine.  Either a single character, or a word in parenthesis, may be shown by Emacs:

|| || Word       || Meaning         || Used by               ||
|| ##:## || ##(Unix)## || Line feed       || Unix, Linux, !MacOS X ||
|| ##/## || ##(MAC)##  || Carriage return || classic Macintosh (not !MacOS X) ||
|| ##\## || ##(DOS)##  || Both            || Microsoft, DEC, RFCs  || 

: ''The ##win.ini## file uses the DOS/Windows end-of-line format ['''G'''].  The others are using the OS native format.''

=== Modification ===

The next two characters in the mode line indicate whether or not the buffer has been modified, or is read-only against modification.

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##**## || modified since last save ||
|| ##--## || not modified since last save ||
|| ##%*## || read-only, but modified ||
|| ##%%## || read-only, not modified ||

: ''File ##spell.el## has been modified ['''L'''].  File ##win.ini## is read-only ['''H'''].

=== Buffer name ===

Every buffer has a name.  Conventionally, this is the file name being visited.

: ''Three files are shown: File ##short-unicode## ['''B'''], file ##win.ini## ['''K'''], and file ##spell.el## ['''N'''].''

=== Position ===

After the buffer name comes the current position -- where TextCursor and [[Point]] are located.

By default, the position is given first as the relative portion of the file visible:

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##Top## || the ''beginning'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##Bot## || the ''end'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##All## || ''all'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##xx%## || percent of the buffer ''above'' the ''top'' of the window (the portion before the visible text) ||

: ''The entire file ##short-unicode## is visible ['''C'''].  The first line of file ##win.ini## is visible ['''E'''].   Lastly, point is 38% ['''P'''] into the file ##spell.el##.''

After the portion comes the line number, prefixed by ##L##.  Optionally, column number may appear as well, with ##C## prefix.

: ''Point is on line 47 ['''R'''] of file ##spell.el##.

=== Modes ===

Last are the mode(s) applied to the buffer, all in a single set of parenthesis.  First comes the [[MajorMode]], followed by any [[MinorMode]]s.

Square brackets around the mode parenthetical -- like this: ##[(Emacs-Lisp)]## -- indicate a RecursiveEdit is in progress.

One can click the major-mode and minor-mode names to get a menu of related options (Emacs 22+).

: ''File ##short-unicode## is in Fundamental mode ['''D'''], meaning no particular major mode is applied.  File ##win.ini## is using `conf-mode', with  the !WinIni variant ['''F'''].  File ##spell.el## is in `emacs-lisp-mode' ['''S'''], with minor modes `eldoc-mode' ['''T'''] and `visual-line-mode' ['''U'''].
