The '''[::mode line]''' appears at the bottom of every Emacs internal [[window]].  It has useful summary information about the buffer shown in the window, including its name and current modes.

== Parts of the mode line ==

This screenshot shows three internal Emacs windows, each with a mode line at the bottom.  The mode lines use black text on a yellow/beige background, and are called out with blue lines.

[[image:DrewsEmacsWindowCallouts]]

The information in a mode line usually includes the following:
* Whether or not the buffer has been modified:
** ##**## -- modified since last save
** ##--## -- not modified since last save
** ##%*## -- read-only, but modified
** ##%%## -- read-only, not modified
** In the screenshot, buffers ##*Help*## and ##drews-lisp-20## are read-only (unmodified); buffer ##shrink-fit.el## is writable and unmodified.
* Buffer name -- For example the file name being visited
* The name of one or more [[MajorMode]]s or [[MinorMode]]s of the buffer, surrounded by parentheses
** One can click the major-mode and minor-mode names to get a menu of related options (Emacs 22+)
** Square brackets -- like this: ##[(Emacs-Lisp)]## -- indicate a RecursiveEdit

* Line number of the TextCursor and [[Point]], and perhaps the column number
** In the screenshot, in buffer ##shrink-fit.el##, the cursor is in column 0 (##C0##) of line 234 (##L234##)
* Position in buffer:
** ##Top## -- the ''beginning'' of the buffer is shown in the window
** ##Bot## -- the ''end'' of the buffer is shown in the window
** ##All## -- ''all'' of the buffer is shown in the window
** A percentage, like ##42%## -- amount of the buffer ''above'' the ''top'' of the window (the portion before the visible text)
** In the screenshot, the first ##48%## of buffer ##shrink-fit.el## is not shown
* Coding system of the buffer (related to the characters used for different human languages)
** ##-## -- no code conversion, except possibly end-of-line translation
** ##=## -- no code conversion ''or'' end-of-line translation
** ##1## -- ISO Latin 1 code conversion
** Anything else -- Some other code conversion.  See [[Manual:International Character Set Support]] in the Emacs manual
** All of the buffers in the screenshot have no conversion applied (##-##)
* End-of-line translation:
** ##(Unix)## -- newline character separates lines, as used by Unix, Linux and !MacOS X
** ##(DOS)## or ##\## -- carriage-return plus linefeed separates lines, as used by Microsoft, DEC, and others
** ##(MAC)## or ##/## -- carriage-return separates lines, as used by classic Macintosh (not !MacOS X)
** All of the buffers in the screenshot have newline-separated lines (##(Unix)##)
