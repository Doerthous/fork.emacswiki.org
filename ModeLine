The '''[::mode line]''' appears at the bottom of every Emacs internal [[window]].  It has useful summary information about the [[buffer]] shown in the window, including its name and current [[mode]]s.

Like the rest of Emacs, you can [[ModeLineConfiguration|configure the mode line]] to look and behave however you want.

The Emacs user manual has an explanation of the [[Manual:Mode Line]], and the technical manual explains the internal [[Manual:Mode Line Format]].

== Appearance ==

This screenshot shows Emacs 27.1 (circa 2020).  Three buffers visiting files are shown, each in a [[window]] with a mode line at the bottom.  The mode lines use black text on a grey/silver background.  The main parts of the window use a white background.

== Components ==

The standard (default) components of a mode line, from left to right, are as follows.

: ''References to the screenshot above are given in indented italics, with the callouts in [square brackets].''

=== Human Language ===

The first part of the mode line is concerned with human-language (as opposed to programming-language) details.

If an input method is active, it can be indicated first, depending on your terminal type.

Next comes the coding system of the buffer -- one or more characters indicating how the given language is encoded as bytes in the buffer.

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##-## || No code conversion, except possibly end-of-line translation ||
|| ##=## || No code conversion ''or'' end-of-line translation ||
|| ##1## || ISO Latin 1 code conversion ||
|| ##U## || Unicode (typically UTF-8) ||

: ''The file buffer ##short-unicode## contains Unicode text ['''A'''].  The other two buffers have no translation (aside from end-of-line).''

See [[Manual:International|International Character Set Support]] in the Emacs manual for details.

=== End Of Line ===

Next in the mode line is an indication of how an EndOfLine is represented in the buffer.  This is either a single character, or a word in parenthesis:

|| Char || Word       || Meaning         || Used by               ||
|| ##:## || ##(Unix)## || Line feed       || Unix, Linux, !MacOS X ||
|| ##/## || ##(MAC)##  || Carriage return || classic Macintosh (not !MacOS X) ||
|| ##\## || ##(DOS)##  || Both            || Microsoft, DEC, RFCs  || 

: ''The ##win.ini## file buffer uses the DOS/Windows end-of-line format ['''G'''].  The others use the OS native format.''

=== Buffer Modification ===

The next two characters in the mode line indicate whether or not the buffer has been modified, can be edited but is unmodified since last saving, or is read-only.

|| Chars || Meaning ||
|| ##**## || modified since last save ||
|| ##--## || not modified since last save ||
|| ##%*## || read-only, but modified ||
|| ##%%## || read-only, not modified ||

: ''File buffer ##spell.el## has been modified ['''L'''].  File buffer ##win.ini## is read-only ['''H'''].

=== Buffer Name ===

Every buffer has a name.  If the buffer is visiting a file then this is normally the file name.

: ''Three file buffers are shown: ##short-unicode## ['''B'''], ##win.ini## ['''K'''], and ##spell.el## ['''N'''].''

=== Cursor Position ===

After the buffer name comes the current position of the TextCursor in the buffer (that is, [[point]] -- actually, it's the ''window'' point, that is, the value of point in the given window).

This is described relative to the visible portion of the buffer -- more precisely, the portion of the buffer that's presented in the window, including any parts you need to scroll to see. If the buffer is ''narrowed'' then this "visible portion" is the ''buffer restriction'' (the narrowing); otherwise it is the entire buffer contents.

(For brevity here, we'll write just "buffer", but understand that what's meant is "buffer restriction" (narrowing), if the buffer is narrowed.)

By default, the position is described first as the portion of the buffer that's currently visible (without scrolling):

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##Top## || the ''beginning'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##Bot## || the ''end'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##All## || ''all'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##xx%## || percent of the buffer ''above'' the ''top'' of the window (the portion before the visible text) ||

: ''The entire buffer ##short-unicode## is visible ['''C'''].  The first line of ##win.ini## is visible ['''E'''].   Lastly, point is 38% ['''P'''] into buffer ##spell.el##.''

Next comes the line number, prefixed by ##L##.  Optionally, the column number may appear as well, with prefix ##C##.

: ''The cursor is on line 47 ['''R'''] of buffer ##spell.el##.''

=== Modes ===

Last are the [[mode]]s applied to the buffer, in parentheses.  First is the [[MajorMode]], followed by [[MinorMode]]s. (Some minor modes might not be indicated here, to save space.  This is mode-specific and is sometimes user-configurable.)

Square brackets around the modes -- like this: ##[(Emacs-Lisp)]## -- indicate that a RecursiveEdit is in progress.

You can click the major-mode and minor-mode names to access their menus and some of their [[option]]s.

: ''Buffer ##short-unicode## is in Fundamental mode ['''D'''].  Buffer ##win.ini## is in `conf-mode', with the !WinIni variant ['''F'''].  Buffer ##spell.el## is in `emacs-lisp-mode' ['''S'''], with minor modes `eldoc-mode' ['''T'''] and `visual-line-mode' ['''U'''].
