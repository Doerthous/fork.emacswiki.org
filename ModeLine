The '''[::mode line]''' appears at the bottom of every Emacs internal [[window]].  It has useful summary information about the [[buffer]] shown in the window, including its name and current [[mode]]s.

Like the rest of Emacs, you can [[ModeLineConfiguration|configure the mode line]] to look and behave however you want.

== Appearance ==

=== Graphical ===

This screenshot shows Emacs 27.1 (circa 2020).  Three buffers visiting files are shown, each in a [[window]] with a mode line at the bottom.  The mode lines use black text on a grey/silver background.  The main parts of the window use a white background.

[[image:ModeLineCalloutsScreenShot]]

=== Text ===

Text-only character cell displays (like xterm) will appear slightly different.  Following are reproductions of what the mode-lines would look like for the same three windows above (same files, same version of Emacs, same config and state).

    -UUU:----F1      short-unicode   All L4    (Fundamental) --------------------
    -UU-(DOS)%%--F1  win.ini         Top L5    (Conf[WinIni]) -------------------
    -UU-:----F1      spell.el        38% L47   (Emacs-Lisp ElDoc Wrap) -----

The spacing has been modified to align selected parts.

== Components ==

The standard (default) components of a mode line, from left to right, are as follows.

: ''References to the screenshot and text above are given in indented italics, with the callouts in [square brackets].''

=== Human Language ===

The first part of the mode line is concerned with human-language (as opposed to programming-language) details.

If an input method is active, it may be indicated first.  Next comes the coding system of the buffer -- one or more characters indicating how the given language is encoded as bytes in the buffer.

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##-## || No code conversion, except possibly end-of-line translation ||
|| ##=## || No code conversion ''or'' end-of-line translation ||
|| ##1## || ISO Latin 1 code conversion ||
|| ##U## || Unicode (typically UTF-8) ||

: ''The file buffer ##short-unicode## contains Unicode text ['''A'''].  The other two buffers have no translation (aside from end-of-line).  (FIXME explain the multiple U's in text mode)''

See [[Manual:International|International Character Set Support]] in the Emacs manual for details.

=== End Of Line ===

Next in the mode line is an indication of how an EndOfLine is represented in the buffer.  This is either a single character, or a word in parenthesis:

|| Char || Word       || Meaning         || Used by               ||
|| ##:## || ##(Unix)## || Line feed       || Unix, Linux, !MacOS X ||
|| ##/## || ##(MAC)##  || Carriage return || classic Macintosh (not !MacOS X) ||
|| ##\## || ##(DOS)##  || Both            || Microsoft, DEC, RFCs  || 

: ''The ##win.ini## file buffer uses the DOS/Windows end-of-line format, indicated by ##(DOS)## ['''G'''].  The others use the OS native format, indicated by ##:## (colon).''

=== Buffer Modification ===

The next two characters in the mode line indicate whether or not the buffer has been modified, can be edited but is unmodified since last saving, or is read-only.

|| Chars || Meaning ||
|| ##**## || modified since last save ||
|| ##--## || not modified since last save ||
|| ##%*## || read-only, but modified ||
|| ##%%## || read-only, not modified ||

: ''File buffer ##spell.el## has been modified (##**##) ['''L'''].  File buffer ##win.ini## is read-only (##%%##) ['''H'''].

=== Frame Title ===

For text mode terminals, the FrameTitle is given next.  This is omitted from the mode-line for graphical displays (as the frame title typically appears in the title bar of the external host GUI window).

: ''The first frame title is ##F1## for text displays.''.

=== Buffer Name ===

Every buffer has a name.  If the buffer is visiting a file then this is normally the file name.

: ''Three buffers are shown, all visiting files: ##short-unicode## ['''B'''], ##win.ini## ['''K'''], and ##spell.el## ['''N'''].''

=== Cursor Position ===

After the buffer name comes the current position of the TextCursor in the window (that is, [[point]]).  The position is described first as the portion of the buffer that's currently visible in the window:

|| || Meaning ||
|| ##Top## || the ''beginning'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##Bot## || the ''end'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##All## || ''all'' of the buffer is shown in the window ||
|| ##xx%## || percent of the buffer ''above'' the ''top'' of the window (the portion before the visible text) ||

: ''The entire buffer ##short-unicode## is visible ['''C'''].  The first line of ##win.ini## is visible ['''E'''].   Lastly, point is 38% ['''P'''] into buffer ##spell.el##.''

Next comes the line number, prefixed by ##L##.  Optionally, the column number may appear as well, with prefix ##C##.

: ''The cursor is on line 47 ['''R'''] of buffer ##spell.el##.''

If the buffer is [[narrowing|narrowed]] then the position is reported relative to the ''buffer restriction'' (the narrowing), not the entire buffer.


=== Modes ===

Last are the [[mode]]s applied to the buffer, in parentheses.  First is the [[MajorMode]], followed by [[MinorMode]]s.

Square brackets around the modes -- like this: ##[(Emacs-Lisp)]## -- indicate that a RecursiveEdit is in progress.

You can click the major-mode and minor-mode names to access their menus and some of their [[option]]s.

: ''Buffer ##short-unicode## is in Fundamental mode ['''D'''].  Buffer ##win.ini## is in `conf-mode', with the !WinIni variant ['''F'''].  Buffer ##spell.el## is in `emacs-lisp-mode' ['''S'''], with minor modes `eldoc-mode' ['''T'''] and `visual-line-mode' (##Wrap##) ['''U'''].

Not all minor modes may appear in the mode-line.  This is mode-specific and is sometimes user-configurable.
