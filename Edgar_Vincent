Hi, I'm Edgar Vincent. You can reach me on Matrix (edgar.vincent@matrix.org) and by email (e-v@posteo.net).

I wrote a package for Doom Emacs which makes Eshell 'follow' the active buffer's directory. You might find it useful. 
It can be downloaded from there: https://git.sr.ht/~e-v/eshell-follow.el
