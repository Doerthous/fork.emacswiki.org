I started using Emacs on VAX/VMS, probably sometime in 1987. (I remember having to edit the source code to simplify expressions that caused the DEC C compiler to crash.) Sometimes I still use it on VAX/VMS today, on an emulated VAX that I maintain, but most of the time I use it on macOS, Linux, OpenBSD, or NetBSD.
