== What is Powershell? ==

!PowerShell is Microsoft's modern command line shell and scripting language, targeted especially at IT management and automation.  It's effectively a command line environment for the .NET Framework (which is their answer to Java and Java's standard libraries).  Syntactically, !PowerShell strongly resembles [[Perl]]; semantically, it's a bit more like [[Python]]; with a bit of DEC VMS thrown in for flavor.  Introduced in 2006 as a Windows-only thing, !PowerShell is now available for Mac and Linux, too.  It is still under active development in  2021.  !PowerShell source code files typically have extensions of ##.ps1## or ##.psm1##.

As of Emacs 27.1, there is no "official" `powershell-mode', but there have been various third-party implementations:

=== HTTP GET via Powershell ===

Some people report that the url.el exhibits problems when retrieving content from https: endpoints. 
This fn performs a "wget" using Powershell.  Works only on Windows.

    (defun wget-via-powershell (url &optional ext)
      "get the contents of a URL into a file via powershell. The EXT
            is the extension to use on the destination file. It should begin
            with a dot.

== Discussion ==
Just beginning to collect resources.  I couldn't archive copies of these files into the ElispArea, as there is no copyright info in either of them! -- PatrickAnderson

[new]
FYI, there are copies of these files in [[EmacsW32]] (which I am going to upload to Launchpad when I get time).

[new]
I've updated Powershell.el, with a copyright and proper license, as well as some tightening of the code. 
20 May 2010.   -- DinoChiesa

Hi Dino. I upgraded to the latest version 0.2.1 from 0.1. The new version seems to have this problem. Start powershell, then close buffer. Then, when you start standard shell, it no longer have prompts, and is in fact running powershell, not bash or cmd.ex. -- [[Xah Lee]], 2010 June 24

[new]
Hi Xah. I'll have to look into that. I've been out-of-the-office for an extended period, so I'm catching up on some old stuff.  Will look into this and get back to you here. -- DinoChiesa, 2010 Nov 13

When I ran it on emacs 23.1 it would fail with "invalid argument, looking for stringp got nil" (to that effect) on 
{{{
    (if (string-match (concat "^" powershell-prompt-regex "\\(.*\\)\\'")
                       powershell-command-reply)
}}}
I changed the if statement to skip if power-shell-command-reply is null, and set it to "", still get a startup error but it works (normally as far as I can tell but I'm not sure if I'm missing any highlighting I'm supposed to get.  Here's my workaround
{{{
        (if (and (not (null powershell-command-reply))
		    (string-match (concat "^" powershell-prompt-regex "\\(.*\\)\\'")
                             powershell-command-reply))
               (setq powershell-command-reply
                     (substring powershell-command-reply
                                (match-beginning 1)
                                (match-end 1)))
	     (setq powershell-command-reply "")
	     )
}}}
