Yeah, yeah, I know, the name is kinda generic...

Code and documentation moved here: https://github.com/mathiasdahl/quick-buffer-cycle

Similar packages:

* CycleBuffer
* SwBuf
* SwitchingBuffers#BufferCycling
* ControlTABbufferCycling - A page that focuses on this approach, which is not really "cycling".

Enjoy!
