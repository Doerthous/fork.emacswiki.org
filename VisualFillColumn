##visual-fill-column-mode## is a small Emacs minor mode that mimics the effect of FillColumn in VisualLineMode.  Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, which is the standard behaviour of ##visual-line-mode##, it wraps lines at ##fill-column##.  If ##fill-column## is too large for the window, the text is wrapped at the window edge.

And thus is is more of an analog to the (now defunct) LongLines mode, than the previously recommended / linked VisualLineMode.

As this may best be told in images, you might want to take a quick look at the home page of their GitHub repo: https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column where they have a photo clearly demonstrating this.
