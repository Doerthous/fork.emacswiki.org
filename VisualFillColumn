Visual Fill Column is a small Emacs minor mode that mimics the effect of FillColumn in VisualLineMode.  Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, which is the standard behaviour of ##visual-line-mode##, it wraps lines at ##fill-column##.  If ##fill-column## is too large for the window, the text is wrapped at the window edge.

And thus it is more of an analog to the (now defunct) LongLines mode, than the previously recommended / linked VisualLineMode (at least by itself).  So perhaps it is more accurate to say, the two of them put together are the new analog to the old LongLines mode.

For a visual representation, you might want to take a quick look at the home page of their GitHub repo: https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column where they have a photo clearly demonstrating the feature.

If you are looking for a similar (soft) wrap on the *left* side, without indenting *everything* in the way that say, OrgIndentMode does, you may be interested in AdaptiveWrap.
