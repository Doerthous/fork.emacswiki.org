Planet Emacsen was an aggregation of the blogs of Emacs users, run by Tess O'Connor. It is now offline[1], and has been replaced by https://planet.emacslife.com . If you prefer to read NNTP with a news client such as Gnus, Planet Emacsen is available through news.gwene.org .

Thank you, Tess, for running Planet Emacsen on behalf of the community for so many years!

It was first announced here on the EmacsWiki on [[2006-10-25]].
