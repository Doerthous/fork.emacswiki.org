I'm sure we don't like drive-by questions but I don't see how there are going to be any consequences for people who left the channel. Unless this document is going to turn into a general IRC netiquette thing. :)

Nothing is changing with Freenode, please read https://freenode.net/ and I don't think that statement about Libera.chat is fair.

What would be better is to state:

- how to connect to Freenode
- how to connect to Liberchat

there is no need to mention controversies, Freenode is just same
